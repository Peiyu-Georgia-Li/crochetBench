Five stitches need to be decreased evenly spaced across each of the next 5 rows.\n2. Decreases are worked in the dc3tog valleys.

Markers are used to indicate the 5 valleys in which decreases will be worked. Move the markers to new locations before each decrease row, to spread out the decreases evenly over the rows.\n4. Use of markers is optional. If you do not wish to use markers, remember to work dc4tog instead of dc3tog over 5 evenly spaced valleys and take care to work fewer dc stitches to the next peak, so that peaks are kept aligned over peaks and valleys are aligned over valleys.\n5.
