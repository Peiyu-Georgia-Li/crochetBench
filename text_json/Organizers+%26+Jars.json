Dry flat away from heat and direct sunlight. Trim piece if necessary to measurements 5 x 20 ins [12.5 x 51 cm]. IMPORTANT TO KNOW BEFORE FELTING Record all the measurements and changes before and after felting. You will be able to adjust the method to produce proper results. Always test a sample. Different colored yarns may felt differently. Colorfastness can be affected by very hot water. Any crochet that has been properly felted becomes very dense and matted. HOW TO FELT Using low water level, run a Hot/Cold cycle for 5 to 15 min. Add a pair of old jeans for agitation. Add 2 tablespoons of baking soda for a small load. After one cycle, check for size. Repeat if necessary. Run through the rinse and dry spin cycle. Do not use a clothes dryer. Lay felted piece onto a dry towel, away from direct heat or sunlight. Shape piece to correct measurements. If an edge ripples, baste a thread through the edge and gather in. Remove the thread after the felting is dry. Fold bottom 4 ins [10 cm] to RS to form pocket and top 6 ins [15 cm] to WS of piece (see Diagram). Blanket st through both thicknesses along sides of piece. Trace a 2\u00bd ins [6 cm] diameter circle 1 \u00bd ins [4 cm] down from top fold and carefully cut it out. Blanket st around \u201chole\u201d.",

Glue the ends of the felt down, but do not glue the felt on the round part of the ball, as it will make it difficult to pin into. Do not use hot glue, as this can melt the foam. Place a few pins in the ball to hold everything together while it dries. Let it dry upside down so it does not stick to your surface. 3. Cut a piece of felt to cover the bottom cut edge of the ball and glue it on. Place a few pins in the ball to hold everything together while it dries. Let it dry upside down so it does not stick to your surface. 4. Sew a Flower and button on top of the Pin Cushion (optional). 5. Place the felt-covered foam ball half inside the Pin Cushion cover, then glue the bottom of the ball to the top of the Mason jar lid. When the glue is dry, slip the outer piece of the jar lid into place. 6. Cut 5 strands of yarn each 20\u201d (51 cm) long. Thread the strands through Round 2 of the Lid Side Band, referring to photo for placement. Place the Lid Side Band around the outer piece of the jar lid and tie the strands of yarn together, then clip the ends. Slide the tied strings around until the knot is inside the Band, or sew a Flower and button over the knot.",
