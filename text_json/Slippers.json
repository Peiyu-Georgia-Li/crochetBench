Pin fluffy coat to right side of slipper with rolled edging peeking out over the top edge of the fluffy coat. With yarn tails of fluffy coat, stitch under and around the rolled edges. Using photograph as a guide and with yarn tails, stitch each ear, working through both sets of loops of Round 11, to head of sheep. Using yarn tails of eyelashes, stitch eyelashes onto face (or, if desired, using photograph as a guide, embroider eyelashes with C onto outer toe). With C and using photograph as a guide, embroider nose and mouth under the eyelashes. Weave in all ends. Block if desired.",
