Place markers on Round 1 of brim, inside hat, placing one on each side of 26 (28, 30) sts centered at back of hat. \nAttach Hair: Attach a fringe to each of the 26 (28, 30) sts, as follows:\nCut four 12\u201d lengths of C. Hold the lengths together and fold in half. Insert hook, from inside of hat, into one of the stitches, insert hook into the fold of C and draw the fold through forming a loop (only draw the fold through, do not draw the strands all the way through). Insert the ends of the strands into the loop and pull to tighten.\nTangle Hair: Separate the plies of the strands. A comb or brush may help. Pull the plies apart beginning at the bottom of each strand. Use the hair ratting technique to tangle the yarn.",

Work stitches of first round in the ring. \nAfter the first round of stitches is worked, pull \ngently on tail to tighten ring.\nNotes\n1. Hat is worked in rounds beginning at \ntop of hat. Sections of single crochet are \nalternated with sections of a texture pattern \ncreated with half double crochet and slip \nstitches. In single crochet sections, the last \nstitch of each round is joined to the first \nstitch with a slip stitch. In texture pattern \nsections, only the first and last rounds are \njoined. Pay careful attention to instructions \nto know when to join and when not.\n2. The texture pattern is created by working \nhalf double crochet stitches into the slip \nstitches and slip stitches into the half \ndouble crochet stitches of the previous \nround. When working increase rounds not \nall half double crochet stitches are worked \ninto slip stitches and not all slip stitches are \nworked into half double crochet stitches, \nbut half double crochet stitches are always \nalternated with slip stitches.\n3. Only turn rounds when instructed to do \nso.

Weave 15 strands of yarn thru the bottom edge of one earflap. Divide strands of yarn into 3 sections (10 strands each) and braid. Knot ends to secure.\nMake 2 large yarn pompoms and attach one to each braid, if desired.\nNote from Marly: I would like to thank Jennifer Pionk for her contribution to the Chic Sheep by Marly Bird\u2122 collection. Jennifer\u2019s sense of style and design aesthetic are a perfect match for this wonderful yarn and pattern collection. I think you will agree that the Entwined Chic hat is the perfect combination of fun, fashionable and chic crochet.

The Speed Starch provides structure to the Hat without being stiff. \n1. Dampen the hat and prepare a tea towel with a cup that will hold up the middle of the hat. \n2.Generously spray the hat, especially the brim on the top and underside. \n3. Place the hat on a tea towel and over the cup so it holds up the middle of the hat. Shape the brim into a circle. \n4. Let the hat naturally dry over 12 to 24 hours.",

Changes for sizes Small, Medium, Large, and X-Large are in parentheses. Special Technique: Adjustable-ring method = Wrap yarn in a ring, ensuring that the tail falls behind the working yarn. Grip ring and tail firmly between middle finger and thumb. Insert hook through center of ring, yarn over (with working yarn) and draw up a loop. Work stitches of first round in the ring, working over both strands (the tail and the ring). After the first round of stitches is worked, pull gently, but firmly, on tail to tighten ring. Join with sc = Place a slip knot on hook, insert hook in indicated stitch, yarn over and draw up a loop, yarn over and draw through both loops on hook. Color Sequence: At the end of each round, change color as in the following sequence: Work 1 round with A, 1 round with B, 1 round with C, 1 round with D. Notes: 1. Hat is made in joined rounds with earflaps worked back and forth in rows. 2. Chain 1 at the beginning of a round or row does not count as a stitch. 3.

Left Earflap: With right side facing, join D with slip st in marked st and work same as right earflap. Edging: Round 1 (right side): With right side facing, join A with sc in any st at center back between earflaps, *sc in each st to next earflap; working in ends of rows down first side, 2 sc in each row, sc in each st of Row 8 (9, 10, 11, 12); working in ends of rows up other side, 2 sc in each row; repeat from * once, sc in each remaining st; join with slip st in first sc. Fasten off. FINISHING: With B, following pompom maker directions, make three 2\u201d (5 cm) pompoms or make pompoms as follows: Wrap yarn around 2\u201d (5 cm) piece of heavy cardboard (the more wraps, the fuller the pompom). Gently remove wraps from cardboard. Cut a 12\u201d (30.5 cm) length of B and tie it tightly around center of wraps. Do not cut the ends of this center tie. Cut ends of wraps. Fluff and trim pompom. Use ends of center tie to attach pompoms. Tie one pompom to top of hat through Round 1 and one pompom through ch-1 space at end of each earflap. Weave in ends.",

Fasten off, leaving a long tail for sewing Brim to Cap.\n\nFINISHING\nCAP\nPlace lengths of Peel and Stick adhesive from top of crown down sides of purchased Cap. Take off only the back layer of the tape using Cap seams as guides and pressing firmly into place. Once tape is positioned, place joined crocheted piece onto Cap, centering 1 Motif at front. Working from top down, carefully peel top layer of tape off and press crocheted piece into place, stretching slightly. Once crocheted piece is properly in position and adhered, it\u2019s a good idea to further secure it by placing lengths of Peel and Stick along bottom edge.\nBRIM\nBefore attaching Brim, it\u2019s helpful to place a st marker at center of Brim piece and also mark center of purchased Cap brim. Place lengths of Peel and Stick around Cap brim as close to edge as possible. Peel off top layer of tape and attach crocheted Brim piece, ensuring center markers are aligned.\nAfter Brim is attached, sew edge of Brim to cap piece with whipstitch using length of yarn (Black or Soft White).",
