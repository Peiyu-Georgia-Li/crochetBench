Fasten off.\nSpecial Stitch\nhdc2tog = [Yarn over, insert hook in next stitch, yarn over and pull up loop] 2 times, yarn over and draw through all 5 loops on hook.\nSpecial Techniques\nAdjustable-ring = Wrap yarn into a ring, ensuring that the tail falls behind the working yarn. Pinch ring and tail between middle finger and thumb. Insert hook through center of ring, yarn over (with working yarn) and draw up a loop. Work stitches of first round in the ring. After the first round of stitches is worked, pull gently on tail to tighten ring.\nCovering-sc (covering single crochet) = Place a slip knot on hook (1 loop on hook). *Take working yarn over ring to back of ring. Insert hook from front to back through center of ring. Yarn over with working yarn and draw loop to front (2 loops on hook). Bring working yarn back over top of ring to front. Yarn over and draw through both loops on hook (one covering-sc made); repeat from * until the specified number of sc have been worked.\nNotes\n1. The main section of each skull is worked in continuous rounds (spiral). Do not join rounds with a slip stitch and do not turn rounds. The jaw is worked back and forth in rows.\n2. Flowers, nose, and teeth are worked separately and sewn to skull.\n3. Each skull and flower motif is backed with a piece of felt. The felt backing stiffens the pieces, hides the stitching on the back side, and keeps each piece from curling.\n4. The garland can be made longer or shorter by making more or fewer skull and flower motifs.\n\nEYE FLOWERS  \n(make 6 – 2 per skull; 2 each with C, D, and E)\nMake an adjustable ring.\nRounds 1–3: Work same as Rounds 1–3 of skull—18 sts.\nRound 4: [(Sc, hdc) in next st, (hdc, slip st) in next st (petal made)] 9 times—9 petals. \nFasten off, leaving a long tail for sewing.\nEYE FLOWER CENTER  \n(make 6 – 2 per skull)\nWith B, make an adjustable ring.\nRound 1: Work 6 sc in ring; join with slip st in first sc. Fasten off, leaving a long tail for sewing.\nFOREHEAD FLOWERS  \n(make 3 – 1 per skull; 1 each with C, E, and G)\nRound 1 (right side): Work same as Round 1 of skull—6 sc. Place marker for beginning of round and move marker up as each round is completed.\nRound 2: [Slip st in next st, ch 5, working into back bumps of chain, hdc in 3rd ch from hook, sc in next ch, slip st in next ch (petal made)] 5 times, 2 sc in last st—5 petals. \nSlip st in next st and fasten off, leaving a long tail for sewing.\nFOREHEAD FLOWER CENTER  \n(make 3 – 1 per skull; 1 each with C, F, and G)\nMake same as eye flower center.\nNOSE (make 3 – 1 per skull)\nWith B, make an adjustable ring.\nRound 1: [Sc in ring, hdc in ring, sc in ring] 3 times; join with slip st in first sc—9 sts.\nFasten off, leaving a long tail for sewing.\nTEETH (make 3 – 1 per skull)\nWith B, ch 12.\nRow 1: Working in back bumps of chain only, dc in 6th ch from hook (beginning ch counts as one foundation ch, first dc and first ch-1 space), [ch 1, skip next ch, dc in next ch] 3 times—4 ch-1 spaces and 5 dc.\nRow 2: Ch 4 (counts as dc, ch 1), turn, skip first ch-1 space, dc in next dc, [ch 1, skip next ch-1 space, dc in next dc] 2 times, ch 1, skip next ch of turning ch, dc in next ch of turning ch. Fasten off, leaving a long tail for sewing.\nLARGE FLOWER  \n(make 4 – 1 each with C, D, E, G)\nMake an adjustable ring.\nRound 1 (right side): Work 5 sc in ring; do not join with slip st, work in continuous rounds (spiral)—5 sc. Place marker for beginning of round and move marker up as each round is completed.\nRound 2: [Slip st in next st, ch 7, sc in 2nd ch from hook and in next 5 ch (axis made)] 5 times—5 axes.\nRound 3: [Skip next sl st, working in chains at base of sts of next axis, slip st in next 2 ch, sc in next 2 ch, hdc in next ch, 3 hdc in next ch; working in sc on other side of same axis, 3 hdc in first sc, hdc in next sc, sc in next 2 sc, slip st in last 2 sc (petal made)] 5 times—5 petals.\nFasten off, leaving a long tail for sewing.\nLARGE FLOWER CENTER  \n(make 4 – 1 each with C, D, E, and F)\nMake same as eye flower center.\nFLOWER BACKGROUND  \n(make 4 – 1 each with C, D, F , and G)\nRounds 1–5: Work same as Rounds 1–5 of skull—30 sts.\nRound 6: [Sc in next st, hdc in next st, (dc, tr) in next st, (tr, dc) in next st, hdc in next st, sc in next st] 5 times—40 sts. Fasten off.\nCONNECTOR RINGS (make 8)\nWith F, leaving a long beginning tail, work 16 covering-sc into ring; join with slip st in first sc. Fasten off, leaving a long tail. With yarn needle, weave the ending tail through 8 of the sc stitches so that it is positioned opposite the beginning yarn tail.\nFINISHING\nBlock pieces if needed. \nPrepare Felt Backings: Cut one piece of felt to the size and shape of each of the skulls and each of the flower backgrounds. Set aside.\nSkulls: Arrange eye flowers, forehead flowers, and forehead flower centers on skulls using the following color combinations:\nSkull #1: \n   Eye flower: E\n   Forehead flower: G\n   Forehead flower center: C\nSkull #2: \n   Eye flower: D\n   Forehead flower: C\n   Forehead flower center: F\nSkull #3: \n   Eye flower: C\n   Forehead flower: E\n   Forehead flower center: G\nUsing photograph as a guide, pin teeth, nose, eye flowers, and forehead flower to each skull. With yarn tails, sew around all edges of each of the pieces to secure them to the skull. \nPin eye flower centers and forehead flower centers to the center of the eye flowers and forehead flowers, respectively. With yarn tails, sew around edges of the centers to secure them in place. With B, sew several stitches on each eye flower center that radiate outward from the center toward the scalloped outer edges of the eye flower.\nFlower Motifs: Arrange large flowers and flower centers on flower backgrounds using the following color combinations:\nFlower Motif #1: \n   Background: C\n   Large flower: D\n   Large Flower center: F\nFlower Motif #2: \n   Background: G\n   Large flower: C\n   Large Flower center: D\nFlower Motif #3: \n   Background: F\n   Large flower: E\n   Large Flower center: C\nFlower Motif #1: \n   Background: D\n   Large flower: G\n   Large Flower center: E\nUsing photograph as a guide, pin each large flower to a flower background. The center of the flower should be directly on top of the center of the back ground and the bumps around the outer edge of the flower back ground should fit between petals of the large flower. With tails, sew around the edges of the large flowers to secure them to the backgrounds. You will not be able to sew the tips of the large flowers to anything as they stick out past the edges of the background. \nPin large flower centers to the middle of the large flowers. With tails, sew around the outer edges of the centers to secure them in place.\nAssemble Garland\nSkulls, connector rings, and flower motifs should be arranged and sewn together in the following order: Connector ring, flower motif #1, connector ring, skull #1, connector ring, flower motif #2, connector ring, skull #2, connector ring, flower motif #3, connector ring, skull #3, connector ring, flower motif #4, connector ring.\nConnector Rings: With tails of connector rings, sew one connector ring to each side of each skull as follows: Slide yarn needle into the side edge of the skull near the top of the eye flowers. Be careful not to let your stitches show on the right side of the skull. The edging round of slip stitches will help mask your stitches. Weave yarn needle back and forth through the loops on the wrong side of skull to anchor your stitches. Make sure that the ring is pulled up next to the side edge of the skull, and there is no space between the ring and the edge of the skull. Once you have woven the yarn in securely, trim excess. Once you have sewn a connector ring to each side of each skull, you can sew a flower background to the unsewn side of the connector rings, by sewing the flower background to the connector rings, in the same way. There should be one extra connector ring on each end of the garland for hanging. Weave in any remaining ends.\nFelt Backing: Glue each felt piece to the back of the appropriate crochet piece and allow to dry.\nUsing photograph as a guide, glue four rhinestones or sequins above each eye flower, in an angle that slopes downward toward the center of face. Use glitter fabric paint to outline each flower and each flower center.",

Slip st in back loops of each Body st around, slip st in row ends and sts around the head and Ears; join last slip st to 1st slip st. \nOptional: For seamless join, cut yarn from skein but do not finish off. Thread yarn onto tapestry needle. Weave thread under the loops of the next st and back through the middle of the originating st, mimicking the teardrop shape of a st. Weave excess yarn along back of work to secure.\n\nPompom Tails: With F and a 1⅜\" (35mm) pompom maker, (or fork; see below for details), make 1 pompom tail for each bunny. For consistency, ensure that the same number of wraps is used for each pompom. Using sharp scissors, carefully trim each pompom as needed, leaving 4-6\" (10-15.25 cm) yarn ends from tie for attaching pompom to Bunny.\nUsing pompom tie ends, tie pompom on bottom portion of Body between Rounds 2 & 3. Knot securely and trim excess yarn from ties.\n\nFork Method: If pompom maker is unavailable, use a large two-tine meat serving fork to make pompoms as follows: Wrap the yarn snugly (not too tightly) around the entire fork for a total of 35 wraps. Cut yarn. Using a 10\" (25.4 cm) piece of yarn, wrap yarn between the tines and around the middle of the wraps. Pull tightly to cinch and knot securely leaving 4-6\" (10-15.25 cm) yarn ends from tie for attaching pompom to Bunny.\n\nAssembly: With F, ch 20. Attach Bunny ear using slip st through the top most st of the 1st ear, ch 5, repeat ear attachment with slip st to 2nd ear, ch 10; repeat the process until all bunnies are attached, ch 20. There should be 10 chs between each Bunny and 5 chs between the ears of each Bunny. \n\nHanging Loops (optional): Fold the 1st 10 chs of the ch 20 over to form a loop. With yarn needle and using yarn tail, sew to secure. Repeat for opposite end.  \nWith yarn needle, weave in all loose ends.",
