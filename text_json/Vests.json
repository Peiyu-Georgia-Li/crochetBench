Notes: • To begin working with the O’Go format, carefully cut plastic tie where the ends of the O’Go meet. • Pull tie to remove • For this pattern, colors can be easily separated by gently pulling apart and cutting at the color transition. Each color is ready to use. Follow color guide shown in Materials section for each O’Go (Contrast A to J). You may find it helpful to place each color section in its own resealable (zip lock) bag and label each bag A to J. • Vest is worked flat in 2 pieces using crochet intarsia technique and following chart for color placement. • Ribbing is worked side to side and Front and Back pieces are worked onto long edge of Ribbing. • When working from chart, wind small balls of the colors to be used, one for each separate area of color in the design. Start new colors at appropriate points. Do not strand yarn across stitches – use intarsia technique. To change color, work to last 2 loops on hook, yoh with new color and pull through 2 loops on hook to complete st and proceed in new color.

USING THIS GUIDE Click on the underlined words throughout the pattern to access our library of helpful tools. NOTES • Motifs begin with Color 1 (shortest color rep) from center of pull-skein, leaving a 4\" [10 cm] tail to weave in. • Each color aligns with 1 rnd in the Motif with 5 colors in total. If too much color is left at end of rnd, pull back some sts and slightly loosen gauge to re-work sts and finish at color change. If too little color is left, pull back some sts and slightly tighten gauge to re-work sts and finish at color change. • When Motif is complete, cut yarn where Color 5 (longest color rep) ends leaving a tail for weaving in. Begin next Motif with Color 1 and repeat 5 rnds for each Motif. • Granny Square how to: https://www.yarnspirations.com/pages/how-to-granny-square-guide DETERMINING YOUR SIZE Click here to learn how to take proper measurements for the best fit.
