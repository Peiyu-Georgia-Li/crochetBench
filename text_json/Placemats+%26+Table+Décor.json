You may have to tighten or loosen some stitches as you go in order to keep the color pooling intact. Keep a variety of hook sizes on hand to help resize your stitches.\n3. Different dye lots of the same colorway may change the number of stitches obtained in any given color. Count the number of stitches YOU get to work through one full sequence, as well as in each color section, and maintain that throughout the pattern.\n4. The width of your table runner should be approximately one-third the width of your table and allow for 6\" (15 cm) to hang over each end. It shouldn't hang lower than your tablecloth if you're layering linens.\n\nSPECIAL STITCH\nStanding sc = with new yarn, place slip knot on hook and sc in indicated st, as opposed to the traditional joining of new yarn using a slip st.\n\nMOSS STITCH\nCh an even number of sts.\nRow 1: Skip 3 ch, sc in next ch, * ch 1, skip 1 foundation ch, sc in next ch; repeat from * to end, turn.\nRow 2: Ch 2 (counts as a stitch now and throughout), sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end finishing with a sc in last ch-3 space, turn.\nRow 3: Ch 2 (counts as a stitch now and throughout), sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end finishing with a sc in last ch-2 space, turn.\nRepeat Row 3 only for Moss st.\n\nTABLE RUNNER\nWith A, ch through 2 full color sequences, with the last loop on hook being the first loop of a new color just after a color change in the yarn.\nRow 1 (right side): Skip 3 ch (counts as a st), sc in the 4th ch from hook, * ch 1, sc around the foundation ch (instead of going into a ch st); repeat from * until 1 full color sequence has been completed on this row.

Change hook sizes, or actual st used, to get the correct color in place. If you use the same number of sts per color that you counted on Row 1, it will work out.\nRow 3 (right side): Ch 2 (counts as a st now and throughout), sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in the next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end, finishing with a sc in last ch-2 space, turn.\nNote: The color of the sts on this row will shift to the left or right by 1 st from the previous right side row depending on the colorway and if you are right or left handed.

It doesn\u2019t matter which direction the stitch shifts as long as it is off-set by 1.\nRepeat Rows 3 and 4 until Table Runner measures 2\" (5 cm) shorter than desired length, ending on a Row 4 (wrong side row).\n\nFINISHING\nSquish or stretch the sts on foundation chain of Trim to match the width of the rest of the piece. You can slide the sts around along the foundation chain, as with an adjustable ring. Unravel unused foundation ch sts and weave in yarn tail to secure foundation.\n\nEdging\nWith right side facing and working across foundation edge, join B with slip st in foundation ch st under last sc of Row 1.\nRound 1 (right side): Ch 2 (counts as a st now and throughout), sc once more in same ch, * ch 1, sc in next space between sc of Row 1; repeat from * to ch-3 corner space, (ch 1, sc) 3 times in corner space, rotate Table Runner to work along long side edge, (ch 1, sc) in each ch space at edge of every other row to corner sc, (ch 1, sc) twice around corner sc, rotate Table Runner to work along top edge, (ch 1, sc) in each ch-1 space to corner ch-2 space, (ch 1, sc) 3 times in corner space, rotate Table Runner to work along long side edge, (ch 1, sc) in each ch space at edge of every other row to corner sc, (ch 1, sc) twice around corner sc, ch 1, join with sl st in beginning ch 2.\nFasten off.\n\nTwisted Chain Border\nWith right side facing, join C with a standing sc in any ch-1 space, ch 6, elongate loop on hook and remove hook, join D with a standing sc in next ch-1 space, ch 6, elongate loop on hook and remove hook, * place C loop back on hook, sc in next ch-1 space, ch 6, elongate loop on hook and remove hook, place D loop back on hook, sc in next ch-1 space, ch 6, elongate loop on hook and remove hook; repeat from * around, join with slip st in the first sc of each color.\nFasten off.\nWeave in all loose ends.",

You will work into the spaces and posts (at top of each row) between the spaces in the same way that you would work across the top of a row of open-meshes.\n3. When working across the top edge, work into the stitches (each ch and each dc count as one st) of the last row. When working across the lower edge, work into the opposite side of the foundation chain (each ch counts as one st).\n\nWith right side facing, join B with slip st in a corner to work across a long edge of the runner.\n\nRound 1: Ch 3 (counts as first dc), 2 dc in space at end of next row, ***dc at top of same row, *ch 2, skip space at end of next row, dc at top of row, 2 dc in space at end of next row, dc at top of row; repeat from * across long side edge to next corner space, (3 dc, ch 5, 3 dc) in corner space; working across short edge of runner, dc in next st, ch 2, skip next 2 sts (this may be 2 dc or a ch-2 space), dc in next st, **dc in next 3 sts (this may be 3 dc or a ch-2 space and a dc), ch 2, skip next 2 sts, dc in next st; repeat from ** across short edge to next corner space, (3 dc, ch 5, 3 dc) in corner space; repeat from *** to work border across 2nd long side and 2nd short side ending at last corner space, 3 dc in last corner space, ch 5; join with slip st in top of beginning ch-3, do not turn.\n\nRound 2: Ch 5, skip next 2 dc, dc in next dc, *2 dc in next ch-2 space, dc in next dc, ch 2, skip next 2 dc, dc in next dc; repeat from * to next corner space, (3 dc, ch 5, 3 dc) in corner space, [dc in next dc, **ch 2, skip next 2 dc, dc in next dc, 2 dc in next ch-2 space, dc in next dc; repeat from ** to next corner space, (3 dc, ch 5, 3 dc) in corner space] 3 times; join with slip st in 3rd ch of beginning ch-5.\n\nRound 3: Ch 5, skip first ch-space, dc in next dc, **ch 2, skip next 2 dc, dc in next dc, *ch 2, skip next ch-2 space, dc in next dc, ch 2, skip next 2 dc, dc in next dc; repeat from * to next corner space, ch 2, (dc, ch 5, dc) in 3rd ch of corner ch-5, ch 2, skip remainder of corner ch-5, dc in next dc; repeat from ** around, ch 2; join with slip st in 3rd ch of beginning ch-5. \nFasten off.\n\nTRIPLE KNOT FRINGE\nAttach Fringe: Cut 4 strands of B, each 12\u201d (30.5 cm) long. Hold all 4 stands together and fold in half. Insert crochet hook from right side to wrong side through first space on one short edge of runner, place fold on hook and draw fold through to right side, thread ends of strands through loop formed by fold and pull on the ends to tighten (fringe knot made). Repeat this process to attach a fringe to every space across both short ends of runner.\n\nFirst Row of Knots: Turn runner over so wrong side is facing you. Separate first 2 fringes into 2 groups of 4 strands each. Begin with the 2nd group of 4-strands from the first fringe and the first group of 4-strands from the 2nd fringe. Tie the two groups together with an overhand knot and pull tight about \u00be\u201d (19 mm) below the fringe knots. Repeat this process all the way across, leaving the last 4-strand group loose. Repeat across other short edge. Note: The first and last 4-strand groups of each short side should be loose.\n\nSecond Row of Knots: Beginning with the first (un-tied) 4-strand group from previous row, separate the next group of strands into 2 groups of 4-strands each and tie the first of these two 4-strand groups to the previous 4-strand group with an overhand knot about \u00be\u201d (19 mm) below the previous knots. Repeat this process all the way across both short edges. Trim ends as desired.\n\nFINISHING: Weave in ends. Block and starch piece as desired.",
