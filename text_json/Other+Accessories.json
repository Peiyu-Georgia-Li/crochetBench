Special Technique Working fan around fan just made = Yo, insert hook in indicated stitch, bring working yarn to back of piece and wrap around previously made fan, yo, draw up a loop, [yo, pull through 2 loops] twice, *yo, insert hook in same stitch, bring working yarn to back of piece and wrap around same fan, yo, draw up a loop, [yo, pull through 2 loops] twice; repeat from * once. Notes 1. Crossed stitch design is created by working a 3-double crochet fan around a previously made fan. 2. When working around a fan, ensure that the chains between fans are not caught in the stitching. 3. Ribbon backing is added for stability and belt closes with snap fasteners. 4. Belt can be lengthened or shortened to a specific length by increasing or decreasing Rows 4 and 5. You may need additional crochet thread and longer length of ribbon for a longer belt. Row 99 (113, 127, 141, 151): Ch 1, sc in first 2 st, sc2tog, *sc in next 2 st, sc2tog; repeat from * to last st, sc in last st—13 sts. Fasten off. FINISHING Trim ribbon to length 1” (2.5 cm) longer than belt. Fold and press under ½” (12.7 mm) at each end to wrong side; sew ribbon around all 4 sides to wrong side of belt. Leaving a 1” (2.5 cm) overlap, sew snaps on belt.",

Continue to lay the left-hand side of Cord C on the diagram following the path of the knot (see arrows). Use pins to hold cord in place.

Carefully adjust the knot gradually by pulling the cord ends so there are no spaces between the woven cords. Make sure there is at least 7½” (19 cm) of each cord on the left and right side of the knot. (see Diagram 2)\nAssembling the Belt\nLay the woven cords right side up on work surface.

Pin cords onto back of tab using photo as a guide. Repeat Step 3 with other Back Closure Tab and other side of cords. Using a yarn needle and sewing lengths, sew all cords to the wrong side of the Closure Tabs. Weave in ends.\nUsing a yarn needle and a length of yarn, sew together all cords (A to B and C to D) on wrong side of knot. Continue to sew cords together around edges of knot so there are no gaps between the paired cords. Weave in all ends.\nSeparate 2” (5 cm) piece of Hook and Loop Sew-on Fastener – Using sewing needle and matching thread, sew on fastener at edge of Back Closure Tab, adjusting for proper fit. Repeat with other piece of fastener so that it aligns with first piece. The fastening edges of the Back Closure Tabs should overlap approximately 1” (2.5 cm).\nWet block belt unfastened with all cords extending out from knot neatly. Allow to dry overnight.

This retro-look tri-fold Red Cross inspired first aid kit is designed to hold lots of bulky first aid supplies with the help of two gusseted pockets for better organization. Snaps on the inner flaps keep the items secure in the pockets.\n2. Pieces are worked separately and are sewn together. Leave long ends at beginning and end of pieces for sewing. Two Pockets are joined by a gusset piece along bottom edges. Pockets are gusseted and worked in the round for smoother look.\n3. Some steps are worked back and forth in rows and others are worked in the round.\n4. The iconic Red Cross logo is worked with a small hook, using size 3 crochet thread, for a more finely detailed look, and is sewn together using hand-sewing thread.\n\nSPECIAL TECHNIQUES\nAdjustable loop ring: Holding the thread a few inches [cms] from the end, wrap around your finger.
