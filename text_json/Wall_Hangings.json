This would be about 420% enlargement. Lay large size diagram on work surface.\nUsing pliers, bend about 1” (2.5 cm) over at end of wire to form loop. Place wire on diagram, lining loop up with * at center bottom of diagram. Carefully bend wire to match outer path of frame on diagram until wire meets up with beginning loop. Cut wire 1” (2.5 cm) beyond meeting point. Thread this end of wire through starting loop and bend over about 1” (2.5 cm) to lock in place. Cut an 8½” (21.5 cm) length of wire, bending both ends over about 1” (2.5 cm). Slide loops over wire frame at center points * and **. Tighten loops to secure. Note: You may need to shorten center piece to make your frame more-sturdy and hold the butterfly shape.\n\nFlower Motif (make 2 with smaller hook and 2 with larger hook for each butterfly): Ch 5 and join with slip st in first ch to form a ring.\nRound 1: Beg 4-tr cluster in ring, ch 5, [4-tr cluster, ch 5] 4 times in ring; join with slip st to top of beg 4-tr cluster – 5 petals.\nRound 2: Ch 1, sc in first cluster, *ch 7, (sc, ch 5, sc) in next ch-5 space, ch 7**, sc in next cluster; repeat from * around ending last repeat at **; join with slip st in first sc – 10 ch-7 spaces; 5 ch-5 spaces.

Fasten off.\n\nJoining First Flower Motif: Using yarn needle and long length of matching yarn, attach motif to center of appropriate wing section as follows: Tie a knot to frame; *insert needle through next ch-5 or ch-7 space of Motif, insert needle through corresponding position on Round 1 on frame; repeat from * around. Do not fasten off.\n\nJoining of Second and Successive Motifs: Repeat Joining First Motif to join remaining 3 Motifs to Frame, following Assembly diagram for placement. Fasten off and secure yarn after joining all 4 Motifs. Note: Pattern of joining threads can vary from butterfly to butterfly but try to keep each butterfly symmetrical.\n\nFINISHING: Weave in ends. Note: Cut out sequins that remain on yarn tails to make it easier to weave in ends.",

Fasten off.\n\nSpecial Stitches\nFhdc (foundation half double crochet) This technique creates a foundation chain and a row of half double crochet stitches in one = First st: Ch 2, yarn over, insert hook in 2nd ch from hook, yarn over and pull up a loop, yarn over and draw through one loop on hook (the “chain”); yarn over and draw through all 3 loops on hook (first Fhdc completed). Remaining sts: *Yarn over, insert hook into the “chain” of the previous stitch and pull up a loop, yarn over and draw through one loop on hook (the “chain”); yarn over and draw through all 3 loops on hook (the “half double crochet”). Repeat from * until desired length is made.\nFhdc-join = Holding motif with wrong side facing, yarn over, insert hook into the “chain” of the previous Fhdc and into hanging loop of motif, and pull up a loop, yarn over and draw through one loop on hook (the “chain”); yarn over and draw through all 3 loops on hook.\n\nNotes\n1. Banner and motifs are made by holding two strands of thread together.\n2. Star of David motif is made from 2 triangles that are worked in joined rounds with right sides facing and then glued or sewn together.\n3. Motifs are joined to banner in a “join as you go” technique through hanging loop.\n4. Banner can be made to desired length by increasing or decreasing the number of Fhdc. Join additional Star of David motifs at 4” (10 cm) intervals. Additional thread may be necessary for longer banners and additional motifs.\n\nFINISHING\nMotifs\nWith beginning tail, join first and last stitches of Round 1 of each triangle at lower edge; weave in ends. Block and stiffen each triangle to 3¼” (8.5 cm) wide across lower edge x 4” (10 cm) long. Using photograph as a guide, with right sides facing, and with hanging loop of triangle 2 at top, place triangle 1 upside down on top of triangle 2 and sew or glue together where outer edges meet.\n\nBanner\nRow 1: With two strands of A held together, work as many Fhdc as needed for 48” (122 cm) length, alternating colors when joining each motif with Fhdc-join at intervals of 4” (10 cm); change to B in last st, turn.\nRow 2: Ch 1, sc in each st; change to A, turn.\nRow 3: Ch 1, hdc in first st, ch 12, hdc in same st and in each st across, ch 12, hdc in last st.
