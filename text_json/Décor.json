Furthermore, snowflakes can be made easily removable for use as a tree decoration by simply tying the motif onto the band, rather than sewing. Or leave the snowflake motif off entirely.\nTo get a custom fit, plan your design using the dimensions of your container & a gauge swatch. \nUsing a tape measure wrapped all the way around the box or jar to be used record the measurement and subtract 1 - 2\u201d (2.5 x 5.1 cm) to allow for negative ease. This will ensure a tight fit.\nDetermine the number of starting chains required based upon your gauge swatch & number of sts per inch compared to the container dimensions.\n\nWrapper Band (wide version): \nDirection are given for a container with a 17\u00bd\u201d (44.5 cm) in circumference.

Middle Accent (optional)\nThread 2 strands of designated yarn onto yarn needle, weave through the holes created by working both sides of the starting ch, in the center of the finished band. Secure the yarn ends neatly on wrong side of band.  \nWrap band tightly around the gift container and pin ends, overlapping the rounded edge about \u00bd\u201d (1.3 cm) or more as needed. Sew through both layers neatly around the curved end to prevent puckers when band is stretched. \nLikewise, turn the band inside out and sew the loose opposite end to the underneath side of the band. Weave in ends. \nWith matching color yarn, sew snowflake over the overlapped portion of the band or thread yarn through the band and the centered snowflake and tie on with a bow for easy removal for use as tree decoration. Alternatively, leave motif off, weave yarn along center and tie in small yarn bow.",

Insert needle through Cookie from top to bottom and draw tail through. Thread other yarn tail of same Chocolate Chunk onto yarn needle. Skip one stitch on top of Cookie and insert needle through top of Cookie then out bottom of Cookie at same place as first yarn tail. Tie the two tails together at bottom of Cookie, tying tightly to form a dent in Cookie. Trim ends and draw knot inside Cookie to hide. Repeat to attach all remaining Chocolate Chunks, spreading them evenly over top of Cookie.\nFold gold ribbon in half. Insert crochet hook around a few stitches at top of ornament, place ribbon fold on hook and draw through to form a loop. Thread ends of ribbon through loop and pull to tighten.

Grip ring and tail firmly between middle finger and thumb. Insert hook through center of ring, yarn over (with working yarn) and draw up a loop. Work stitches of first round in the ring. After the first round of stitches is worked, pull gently, but firmly, on tail to tighten ring.\nNotes\n1. Only small quantities of B, C, and D are needed for this project.\n2. Gauge is not critical for this project. Work tightly so stuffing does not show through stitches.\n3. For sections worked in continuous rounds, place marker for beginning of round and move marker up as each round is completed. Do not join rounds until instructed to do so.\n4. To change color, work last stitch of old color to last yarn over. Yarn over with new color and draw through all loops on hook to complete stitch. Proceed with new color. In some cases, the old color can be carried up the wrong side (inside) of the piece when next needed. This will reduce the number of ends to weave in later.\ncrochet.

The middle slip stitch will be the tip of the beak. With yarn needle and one of the yarn tails whip stitch the side edges of the folded beak together so that it stays in this folded position. Set aside. The other yarn tail will be used later to sew beak to head.\nTuft (make 1 for each Chick)\nWith A, leaving a long beginning tail for sewing, ch 4.\nRow 1: Slip st in 2nd ch from hook and in next 2 ch, ch 5, slip st in 2nd ch from hook and in next 3 ch; ch 6, slip st in 2nd ch from hook and in next 4 ch.\nFasten off, leaving a long tail for sewing tuft to top of head.\nFINISHING CHICK\nWith B, sew the top of one foot to the bottom of each leg. The front of the leg should be lined up just behind Round 6 of the foot (this is where the first round of increases were made). Make sure that about 3 rounds of the heel of the foot stick out past the back of the leg.\nStuff the legs very firmly. Pin legs to the underside of body. They should be lined up with the center of the Chick\u2019s underside, but placed outward (toward the sides) so that there is about \u00bd\u2013\u00be\u201d (13\u201319mm) of space between the legs. With yarn needle and yarn tails, whipstitch around edge of legs to sew them to the underside of the Chick\u2019s body. Pin Beak to center front of Chick and, with yarn needle and yarn tail, sew in place. Pin wings to sides of body (Note: Wings should not be stuffed; they should be flat). With yarn needle and yarn tails, sew wings to sides of body. With yarn needle and yarn tail, sew tuft to top of head, about \u00bd\u201d (13mm) forward from center. With yarn needle and E, make a large French knot for each eye, and add some horizontal stitches along the sides of the beak to visually separate the top beak from the bottom beak. Weave in all ends.\nBASKET\nBeginning at bottom, with C, make an adjustable ring.\nRound 1 (inside basket): Ch 1, work 6 sc in ring\u20146 sc. Do not join, work in continuous rounds (spiral).

Fasten off. Weave in ends.\nFINISHING-Stiffening: To stiffen bowl, you may use a commercial fabric stiffener and follow the instructions on the label, or use the homemade sugar-and-water method below. To start, cover your work surface with plastic wrap or a garbage bag and several sheets of newspaper. Place large mixing bowl upside-down on top of paper and cover bowl with plastic wrap to make clean-up easier. Experiment with placement of crocheted bowl on top of mixing bowl before you get started \u2013 a smaller/taller bowl will yield a bowl that ruffles at the top, a larger/wider bowl will yield a bowl that is flatter and shorter.\nHomemade Stiffener: Combine 2 cups sugar and 1 cup water in saucepan. Heat on stove just until sugar is dissolved. Be careful as solution is very hot! Remove pan from heat and soak crocheted bowl in solution. Let cool slightly. With tongs, remove crocheted bowl from saucepan and drape over mixing bowl, shaping as desired. Once piece has sufficiently cooled, shape bowl further with fingers. Let dry for at least 3 days. When thread returns to normal color, bowl is stiffened and ready for use.",
