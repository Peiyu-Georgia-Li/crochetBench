        "instructions": "1. Each mitten is worked in Tunisian crochet worked in the round. 2. Tunisian crochet worked in the round is worked with a double-ended crochet hook and 2 strands of yarn. 3. Each round of Tunisian crochet worked in the round consists of two passes; a forward pass and a return pass. In the forward pass, the first strand of yarn is used to pick up and place stitches on the hook. In the return pass, the piece is turned, the stitches slid to the other end of the hook, and the 2nd strand of yarn is used to work off the stitches. 4. The first pass is always worked with the first strand of yarn, A, and with the Right Side facing. 5. The return pass is always worked with the 2nd strand of yarn, B, and the Wrong Side facing. 6. If you hold the hook in your right hand, you will work the forward pass, picking up loops, from right to left. And, you will work the return pass, working off loops, from left to right. If you hold the hook in your left hand, you will work the forward and return passes in the opposite directions. Right Mitten: With B, ch 22 (26, 30, 34). Taking care not to twist ch, join with sl st in back bump of first ch to form a ring. Foundation Round 1 (Right Side): Ch 1, working in back bumps only, sc in same ch as join and in each ch around; join with slip st in first sc—22 (26, 30, 34) sc. Leave last loop of B on hook. cuff: Round 1 (forward pass): With Right Side facing and A, make a slip knot; working in back loops only, insert hook in first sc, place slip knot on hook and draw through the st; leaving loops on hook, *insert hook in next sc, yarn over and draw up a loop; repeat from * until there are about 10 loops on the hook. Note: The exact number of loops picked up in the forward pass can vary. Pick up as many loops as can be worked comfortably without the circle of fabric becoming too bunched up. Round 1 (return pass): Turn the piece so that Wrong Side is now facing and slide the loops to the other end of hook; *with B, yarn over and draw through 2 loops on hook; repeat from * until only 3 loops remain on the hook. Repeat Round 1 forward and return pass until all 22 (26, 30, 34) sts of the Foundation Round have been worked into—22 (26, 30, 34) sts. Place a stitch marker on the first st of Round 1. Move the marker up as each round is completed. Continue to work all rounds in groups of about 10 sts each (as in Round 1) throughout. Round 2 (forward pass): With A, Tks in each st around. Round 2 (return pass): Work same as Round 1 (return pass). Repeat Round 2 until piece measures about 2½ (3, 3½, 4)” from beginning. Work all remaining return passes same as Round 1 (return pass) using B, unless otherwise instructed. Shape thumb Gusset: Round 1: With A, Tks 2, Inc 1, Tks 1, Inc 1, Tks 19 (23, 27, 31)—24 (28, 32, 36) sts. Place a stitch marker in the 6th stitch. Move marker up as each round is worked. Round 2: With A, Tks in each st around. Round 3: With A, Tks 2, Inc 1, Tks in each st to next marked st, Inc 1, Tks in marked st, Tks in each st to end of round—26 (30, 34, 38) sts. Rounds 4–9 (11, 11, 13): Repeat Rounds 2 and 3, 3 (4, 4, 5) more times—32 (38, 42, 48) sts. Round 10 (12, 12, 14): Repeat Round 2. Remove marker. hand: Round 1: With A, Tks 2, yarn over, skip 11 (13, 13, 15) sts (for thumb opening), Tks 19 (23, 27, 31)—22 (26, 30, 34) sts (counting the yarn over as one st). Take care when working the return pass to treat each yarn over as a st. Note: You may wish to put a marker in the yarn over. This is where the yarn will be joined later to work the thumb. Round 2: With A, Tks in each st around. Repeat Round 2 until hand measures about 2½ (3, 3½, 4)”. Shape top: Round 1 (forward pass): With A, Tks in each st around. Round 1 (return pass - decrease): With B, yarn over and draw through 3 loops on hook (Dec 1 made), [yarn over and draw through 2 loops on hook] 6 (8, 10, 12) times, Dec 1, place a marker on the Dec just completed, yarn over and draw through 2 loops on hook, Dec 1, [yarn over and draw through 2 loops on hook] 6 (8, 10, 12) times, Dec 1, yarn over and draw through 2 loops on hook—18 (22, 26, 30) sts. Notes: Take care when working next forward pass to insert hook through both stitches (at once) of a Dec. Move marker up as each round is worked. Round 2: With A, Tks in each st around. Work standard return pass. Round 3 (forward pass): With A, Tks in each st around. Round 3 (return pass - decrease): With B, Dec 1, *yarn over and draw through 2 loops on hook; repeat from * to 1 loop before next marked st, Dec 1, yarn over and draw through 2 loops on hook, Dec 1, **yarn over and draw through 2 loops on hook; repeat from * until 4 loops remain on hook, Dec 1, yarn over and draw through last 2 loops on hook—14 (18, 22, 26) sts. Rounds 4–5 (7, 9, 11): Repeat Rounds 2 and 3, 1 (2, 3, 4) times—10 sts. Round 6 (8, 10, 12): With A, Tks in each st around. On last return pass work until only 1 loop remains on hook, ch 1. Cut B, leaving a 6” tail. Bind off: With Right Side facing and A, insert hook in the first st (as if to work a Tks), yarn over and draw up a loop, *insert hook in next st, yarn over and draw loop through st and through loop on hook; repeat from * around. Cut A, leaving an 8” tail. Thread tail through front loops of bind-off stitches. Pull to gather and close top of mitten. Secure end. thumb: Work rounds of thumb in groups of about 5 or 6 sts. Round 1 (forward pass): Insert hook, front to back, under the horizontal bar where the yarn over was made at the beginning of the thumb opening; with A, yarn over and draw up a loop, insert hook in space before the first skipped st of the thumb opening and draw up a loop, Tks in each of the skipped sts of the thumb opening, insert hook in space following the skipped sts and before the first st of the round and draw up a loop—14 (16, 16, 18) sts. Round 1 (return pass): With Wrong Side facing and B, make a slip knot and place it on the hook, yarn over and draw through 2 loops on hook, Dec 1, *yarn over and draw through 2 loops on hook; repeat from * to last 3 loops, Dec 1—12 (14, 14, 16) sts. Rounds 2–8 (8, 12, 14): With A, Tks in each st around. Size X-large only: Round 15 (forward pass): With A, Tks in each st around. Round 15 (return pass - decrease): With B, *[yarn over and draw through 2 loops on hook] 2 times, Dec 1; repeat from * around—12 sts. Round 16: With A, Tks in each st around. all Sizes: Bind off: Work bind off same as bind off at top of mitten. Cut A, leaving an 8” tail. Thread tail through front loops of bind-off stitches.

Keep a variety of hook sizes on hand to help resize your stitches.\n2. Different dye lots of the same colorway may change the number of stitches obtained in any given color. Count the number of stitches YOU get to work through one full sequence, as well as in each color section, and maintain that throughout the pattern.\nMOSS STITCH\nCh an even number of sts.\nRow 1: Skip 3 ch, sc in next ch, * ch 1, skip 1 foundation ch, sc in next ch; repeat from * to end, turn.\nRow 2: Ch 2 (counts as a stitch now and throughout), sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end finishing with a sc in last ch-3 space, turn.\nRow 3: Ch 2 (counts as a stitch now and throughout), sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end finishing with a sc in last ch-2 space, turn.\nRepeat Row 3 only for Moss st.\nWRISTERS\nWith A, ch through at least 1 full color sequence, with the last loop on hook being the first loop of a new color just after a color change in the yarn. \nRow 1 (right side): Skip 3 ch (counts as as st), sc in the 4th ch from hook, * ch 1, sc around the foundation ch (instead of going into a ch st); repeat from * until 1 full color sequence has been completed on this row. Count the number of sc made in each individual color in the colorway and note it down. Leave remaining ch sts unworked. Undo one st repeat (sc, ch 1), turn.\nRow 2 (wrong side): Ch 2 (counts as a st now and throughout), sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end finishing with a sc in last ch-3 space, turn.\nNote: As you work this row and all remaining rows, you MUST get the correct number of sc in each color in order to maintain the planned color pooling. Change hook sizes, or actual st used, to get the correct color in place. If you use the same number of sts per color that you counted on Row 1, it will work out.\nRow 3 (right side): Ch 2 (counts as a st now and throughout), sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in the next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end, finishing with a sc in last ch-2 space, turn.\nNote: The color of the sts on this row will shift to the left or right by 1 st from the previous right side row depending on the colorway and if you are right or left handed. It doesn’t matter which direction the stitch shifts as long as it is off-set by 1.\nRow 4 (wrong side): Ch 2 (counts as a st now and throughout), sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in the next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end, finishing with a sc in last ch-2 space, turn.\nRows 3-34: Repeat Rows 3 and 4 alternately.\nFasten off. \nMake other Wrister the same.\nFINISHING\nSquish or stretch the sts on foundation chain to match the width of the rest of the piece.
