You may have to tighten or loosen some stitches as you go in order to keep the color pooling intact. Keep a variety of hook sizes on hand to help resize your stitches.\n3. Different dye lots of the same colorway may change the number of stitches obtained in any given color. Count the number of stitches YOU get to work through one full sequence, as well as in each color section, and maintain that throughout the pattern.\n\nMOSS STITCH\nCh an even number of sts.\nRow 1: Skip 3 ch, sc in next ch, * ch 1, skip 1 foundation ch, sc in next ch; repeat from * to end, turn.\nRow 2: Ch 2 (counts as a stitch now and throughout), sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end finishing with a sc in last ch-3 space, turn.\nRow 3: Ch 2 (counts as a stitch now and throughout), sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end finishing with a sc in last ch-2 space, turn.\nRepeat Row 3 only for Moss st.\n\nCOWL\nWith A, ch through at least 1 full color sequence, with the last loop on hook being the first loop of a new color just after a color change in the yarn.\nRow 1 (right side): Skip 3 ch (counts as as st), sc in the 4th ch from hook, * ch 1, sc around the foundation ch (instead of going into a ch st); repeat from * until 1 full color sequence has been completed on this row. Count the number of sc made in each individual color in the colorway and note it down. Leave remaining ch sts unworked. Undo one st repeat (sc, ch 1), turn.\nRow 2 (wrong side): Ch 2 (counts as a st now and throughout), sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end finishing with a sc in last ch-3 space, turn.\nNote: As you work this row and all remaining rows, you MUST get the correct number of sc in each color in order to maintain the planned color pooling. Change hook sizes, or actual st used, to get the correct color in place. If you use the same number of sts per color that you counted on Row 1, it will work out.\nRow 3 (right side): Ch 2 (counts as a st now and throughout), sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in the next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end, finishing with a sc in last ch-2 space, turn.\nNote: The color of the sts on this row will shift to the left or right by 1 st from the previous right side row depending on the colorway and if you are right or left handed. It doesn’t matter which direction the stitch shifts as long as it is off-set by 1.\nRow 4 (wrong side): Ch 2 (counts as a st now and throughout), sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in the next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end, finishing with a sc in last ch-2 space, turn.\nRepeat Rows 3 and 4 until Cowl measures 31\" (78.5 cm), ending on a Row 4 (wrong side row). Fasten off.\n\nFINISHING\nSquish or stretch the sts on foundation chain to match the width of the rest of the piece. You can slide the sts around along the foundation chain, as with an adjustable ring. Unravel unused foundation ch sts and weave in yarn tail to secure foundation.\n\nEdging\nWith right side facing and working across foundation edge, join B with slip st in foundation ch st under last sc of Row 1.\nRound 1 (right side): Ch 2 (counts as a st now and throughout), sc once more in same ch, * ch 1, sc in next space between sc of Row 1; repeat from * to ch-3 corner space, (ch 1, sc) 3 times in corner space, rotate Cowl to work along long side edge, (ch 1, sc) in each ch space at edge of every other row to corner sc, (ch 1, sc) twice around corner sc, rotate Cowl to work along top edge, (ch 1, sc) in each ch-1 space to corner ch-2 space, (ch 1, sc) 3 times in corner space, rotate Cowl to work along long side edge, (ch 1, sc) in each ch space at edge of every other row to corner sc, (ch 1, sc) twice around corner sc, ch 1, join with slip st in beginning ch 2. Do not turn.\nRound 2: Ch 2 (counts as a st now and throughout), sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in next ch-1 space; repeat from * around, join with slip st in first ch-2 space.\nFasten off.\n\nSeaming\nWith wrong side facing and B, use whip st to sew seam as indicated in schematic.\nWeave in all loose ends.\n\nFringe\nAttach fringes at each ch-1 space around outer edge of Cowl as follows:\nCut 3 strands of yarn, 6\" (15 cm) each. Fold strands at center. Use hook to pull center of strands through edge st, then pull ends of strands through the resulting loop and pull tight.",

The rectangle may feel a little stiff but the fabric will loosen and become MUCH more pliable once it has been washed and blocked. Accordingly, the designer recommends that you weave in the ends and block the cowl BEFORE working the border.\n\nBorder\nJoin yarn with slip st at end of one long edge, ch 1, work reverse single crochet evenly spaced across the long edge. Fasten off. Repeat across the other long edge. Sew the short edges of the rectangle together to form cowl.",

Written instructions are provided for the first 3 rows of the chart, then the Cowl is completed by reading all remaining rows from the chart.\n3. The larger hook is used to make all stitches. The smaller hook serves as a cable needle when working cables.\n4. Designer recommends using Susan Bates® Luxite hooks for this project. They are extremely light weight so when used for a cable needle they do not pull the yarn out of shape. Susan Bates® Luxite hooks have a sharper point on the head and also a sharper hook than some crochet hooks. If the stitches get a little tight (which they sometimes do with this type of stitch) one can insert the sharper hook through the stitch if needed. Always try to keep these stitches loose.\n5.

        "instructions": "NOTES\n1. Scarf is worked in figure 8 (infinity) rounds, alternating two rounds worked with A and one round worked with B.\n2. To change color, fasten off old color, and join new color as instructed.\n3. Remember to turn after every round.\n4. There is no obvious RS or WS to the stitch pattern or to the finished wrap.\n\nHELPFUL\n1. To work in the top of a tr4tog: After turning, the backs of the tr4tog will be facing you. The top of the tr4tog is not the loop from the last step of the tr4tog (drawn through the last 5 loops on hook), it is the loop of the ch-1 that follows and closes the cluster. So, as the row faces you, it is the chain just to the right of the body of the tr4tog.\n2. To work in a chain: For stability, work each 4-tr shell into the 2nd ch of the indicated ch-3 sp, not into the space. The back of the chains will be facing you. Insert hook in the chain under the nub and through the loops of the face, under 2 strands each time.\n\n3. For a larger or smaller circumference scarf, add or omit Fsc in multiples of 4. Each additional 4 Fsc will allow one more pattern repeat (one V-st, shell, or tr4tog) to be worked. Each pattern repeat adds about 1 1/4\"/3cm to the circumference.\n4. For a wider or narrower scarf, add or omit repeats of Rounds 1–3 as desired before working the edging. Each additional repeat of Rounds 1–3 adds about 5 1/2\"/14cm to the width.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nNote: Begin with a foundation at the center, and work rounds to the edges.\nWith A, Fsc 128 loosely (to gauge). Turn foundation over so sc edge is on top, begin work across the sc edge.\nFoundation Round: Ch 3, sk first sc, tr3tog over next 3 sc (beginning ch 3 and tr3tog counts as beginning tr4tog), [ch 4, tr4tog over next 4 sc] 31 times, turn; lay foundation flat, taking care not to twist piece yet, bring the ends together. Hold the end with the last loop in place, give a half-twist to the other end so that the chain edge of the foundation is on top; begin work across the chains, [ch 4, tr4tog over next 4 ch] 32 times, end with ch 4, sl st in top of beginning tr4tog, turn—32 tr4tog. Fasten off.\nNote: There is a gap between the beginning and end of the Fsc that you can close now. Thread the beginning tail of the Fsc onto a yarn needle, loop it around the last ch of the foundation, sew back into the beginning Fsc, and if you wish, take a couple of stitches to secure the join.\nRound 1: With B, Air tr in top of any tr4tog, V-st in top of each tr4tog around, end with tr in top of same tr4tog as first st, ch 3, sl st in first Air tr to complete beginning V-st, turn—64 V-sts. Fasten off.\nRound 2: With A, Air tr in 2nd ch of ch-3 sp of any V-st, shell in 2nd ch of ch-3 sp of each remaining V-st around, end with 3 tr in same ch as beginning, sl st in beginning tr to complete beginning shell, turn—64 shells.\nRound 3: Continue with A, ch 3, sk first tr (same tr as join), tr3tog over remaining 3 tr of beginning shell (beginning ch 3 and tr3tog counts as beginning tr4tog), *ch 4, tr4tog over 4 tr of next shell; repeat from * around, end with ch 4, sl st in top of beginning tr4tog, turn—64 tr4tog. Fasten off.\nRounds 4–9: Repeat Rounds 1–3 twice.\nEdging Round: Join B with sl st in any ch-4 sp, ch 1, sc in same ch-4 sp, ch 2, Cl in top of next tr4tog, ch 2, *sc in next ch-4 sp, ch 2, Cl in top of next tr4tog; repeat from * around, end with sl st in first sc. Fasten off.\n\nFINISHING\nUsing yarn needle, weave in all ends. Block wrap, as desired. Tip: It might be unwieldy to try and block this infinity shape flat.",
