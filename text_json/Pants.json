Bring your hands behind your back and tie the strings together like you would tie an apron. The pants should be snug around your waist.\nYou should be left with fabric and two Back Ties hanging down in front of you. This is the back of your pants. Take the fabric and pull it between your legs so it ends up behind you bringing it to waist level. The pants should now cover the back of your legs.\nStarting from behind your back, take one Back Tie in each hand and wrap them around your waist. Tie them together in the front and make sure they\u2019re secure.",

With sewing machine set to longest stitch length, sew \u00bc\" [.5 cm] from folded edge. Note: Be sure to keep fabric flat as this row of machine stitches will later be worked into with crochet hook.\nFoundation row to attach Leg Insert Strip: With RS of jeans facing, beg at hem edge, insert U.S. D/3 (3.25 mm) crochet hook through all layers of fabric from front to back. Yoh with Soft White and draw up a loop, being careful not to split strands of yarn. *Insert crochet hook into next marked spot approx 3/8\" [.75 cm] apart. Yoh and draw up a loop.
