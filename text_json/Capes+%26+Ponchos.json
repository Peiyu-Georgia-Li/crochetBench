(Designer suggests using mini knit clips.) Seam edges together with whip st.\nDesigner Note: once the pieces are pinned in place, take a look and see if the poncho is the right size for you. You could even try it on at this point and see if you wish to make some additions to make the piece a little larger and more custom fit for you.\nAdd some extra length to the panels by working more rows (caution: adding too much length to the panels will make your neckline too big and the poncho will fall off your shoulders) as follows: Raised Chevron Piece: undo the last double crochet row of stitching you completed then join your yarn on the last repeat row the Raised Chevron Panel and only work 1 more full row repeat. Then, work the double crochet row again and fasten off. \nLoopy st Piece: undo the final rows so that the loops are all free. Join your yarn to the last repeat row of the Loopy Chevron Panel and work as many 2 row repeats as necessary to match the new length of the Raised Chevron Panel. \nThen, rebraid where necessary, work the final rows again and fasten off. \nAnd/or: after the seaming is complete, add a couple extra rounds of half double crochet (round 2 of the edging instructions) before doing the final round of the edging to get a little extra around the body. Make Sure that you have the correct stitch multiple when indicated.\n\nBottom Edging\nWith right side facing, join yarn with a slip st in the first st to the left of a corner at bottom edge of Poncho.\nRound 1: Ch 2 (does not count as a st here and throughout), * work in hdc evenly to corner, 3 hdc in corner st and mark center st of 3 hdc just made; repeat from * once more, join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2.\nBe sure to end up with an even number of sts along each of the 2 edges, including corner sts.\nRound 2: Ch 2, * hdc in each st to marked st, 3 hdc in marked st; repeat from * once more, hdc in last hdc, join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2.\nFasten off.\nAttach a fringe at every other stitch along bottom edge as follows:\nCut 3 strands of yarn, 12\" (30.5 cm) each. Fold strands at center. Use hook to pull center of strands through edge st, then pull ends of strands through the resulting loop and pull tight.\nDesigner Note: If you decided to make your panels a bit longer, you may need to work a few extra sts on the first round of the neck edging. Try to add as few sts as possible without puckering the fabric or creating large gaps. Keep track of how many extra sts you added, then place that many markers at top edge, evenly spaced around the neck. On the second row, simply skip all the marked sts to get back to the correct number of sts needed.\n\nFoldover Turtleneck\nWith right side facing, join yarn with slip st anywhere along neck edge.\nRound 1 (right side): Ch 2 (does not count as a st here and throughout), 108 dc evenly around neck edge, join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2 \u2013 108 dc.\nRound 2: Ch 2, * bpdc around next st, fpdc around next st; repeat from * around, join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2.\nRound 3 (decrease round): Ch 2, *[bpdc around next st, fpdc around next st] 7 times, bpdc around next st, fpdc2tog over next 2 fpdc skipping the bpdc between them; repeat from * 5 more times, join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2 \u2013 96 sts,\nRounds 4-6: Repeat Round 2.\nRound 7 (decrease round) Ch 2, *[bpdc around next st, fpdc around next st] 6 times, bpdc around next st, fpdc2tog over next 2 fpdc skipping the bpdc between them; repeat from * 5 more times, join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2 \u2013 84 sts.\nRounds 8-32: Repeat Round 2.\nFasten off.",

With right side facing, join yarn with a slip st at beginning of foundation row and work as follows:\nRow 1 (right side): Ch 1, sc in each of next 5 sts, tacking sc in next st, * sc in each of next 11 sts, tacking sc in next st; repeat from * to last 6 sts, sc in each of last 6 sts.\nFasten off.\nFINISHING\nWith right sides up, match edges as shown in seaming diagram; pin to hold. Seam edges together with whip st.\nDesigner Note: Once the pieces are pinned in place, take a look and see if the poncho is the right size for you. You could even try it on at this point and see if you wish to make some additions to make the piece a little larger and more custom-fit for you.\nAdd some extra length to the panels by working more rows (caution: adding too much length to the panels will make your neckline too big and the poncho will fall off your shoulders) as follows: Raised Chevron Piece: undo the last double crochet row of stitching you completed then join your yarn on the last repeat row of the Raised Chevron Panel and only work 1 more full row repeat. Then, work the double crochet row again and fasten off. Loopy St Piece: Undo the final rows so that the loops are all free. Join your yarn to the last repeat row of the Loopy Chevron Panel and work as many 2 row repeats as necessary to match the new length of the Raised Chevron Panel. Then, rebraid where necessary, work the final rows again and fasten off.\nBottom Edging\nWith right side facing, join yarn with a slip st in the first st to the left of a corner at bottom edge of Poncho.\nRound 1: Ch 2 (does not count as a st here and throughout), * work in hdc evenly to corner, 3 hdc in corner st and mark center st of 3 hdc just made; repeat from * once more, join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2.\nRound 2: Ch 2, * hdc in each st to marked st, 3 hdc in marked st; repeat from * once more, hdc in last hdc, join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2.\nRound 3: Ch 1, work in Crab st around, join with slip st in first sc.\nDesigner Note: If you decided to make your panels a bit longer, you may need to work a few extra sts on the first round of the neck edging. Try to add as few sts as possible without puckering the fabric or creating large gaps. Keep track of how many extra sts you added, then place that many markers at top edge, evenly spaced around the neck. On the second row, simply skip all the marked sts to get back to the correct number of sts needed.\nBig Dramatic Cowl\nWith right side facing, join yarn with slip st anywhere along neck edge.\nRound 1 (right side): Ch 2 (does not count as a st here and throughout), 136 dc evenly around neck edge, join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2 \u2013 136 dc.\nRound 2: Ch 2, * bpdc around next st, fpdc around next st; repeat from * around, join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2.\nRepeat Round 2 only until cowl measures 10\" (25.5 cm). Fasten off.",

(Designer suggests using mini knit clips.) Seam edges together with whip st. Designer Note: once the pieces are pinned in place, take a look and see if the poncho is the right size for you. You could even try it on at this point and see if you wish to make some additions to make the piece a little larger and more custom fit for you. \nAdd some extra length to the panels by working more rows (caution: adding too much length to the panels will make your neckline too big and the poncho will fall off your shoulders) as follows: Raised Chevron Piece: undo the last double crochet row of stitching you completed then join your yarn on the last repeat row the Raised Chevron Panel and only work 1 more full row repeat. Then, work the double crochet row again and fasten off.  Loopy st Piece: undo the final rows so that the loops are all free. Join your yarn to the last repeat row of the Loopy Chevron Panel and work as many 2 row repeats as necessary to match the new length of the Raised Chevron Panel. Then, rebraid where necessary, work the final rows again and fasten off. \nAnd/or: after the seaming is complete, add a couple extra rounds of half double crochet (round 2 of the edging instructions) before doing the final round of the edging to get a little extra around the body. Make sure that you have the correct stitch multiple when indicated.\n\nBottom Edging\nWith right side facing, join yarn with a slip st in the first st to the left of a corner at bottom edge of Poncho.\nRound 1: Ch 2 (does not count as a st here and throughout), * work in hdc evenly to corner, 3 hdc in corner st and mark center st of 3 hdc just made; repeat from * once more, join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2. Be sure to end up with a multiple of 4 sts along each of the 2 edges, including corner sts. This will give you a multiple of 8 sts overall, which is necessary for the final (shell) round to work out properly.\nRound 2: Ch 2, * hdc in each st to marked st, 5 hdc in marked st; repeat from * once more, hdc in last hdc, join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2.\nRound 3: Ch 1, * sc in next st, skip 3 sts, 9 tr in next st, skip 3 sts; repeat from * around, join with slip st in first sc.\nFasten off.\n\nDesigner Note: If you decided to make your panels a bit longer, you may need to work a few extra sts on the first round of the neck edging. Try to add as few sts as possible without puckering the fabric or creating large gaps. Keep track of how many extra sts you added, then place that many markers at top edge, evenly spaced around the neck. On the second row, simply skip all the marked sts to get back to the correct number of sts needed.",

(Designer suggests using mini knit clips.) Seam edges together with whip st.\nDesigner Note: once the pieces are pinned in place, take a look and see if the poncho is the right size for you. You could even try it on at this point and see if you wish to make some additions to make the piece a little larger and more custom fit for you.\nAdd some extra length to the panels by working more rows (caution: adding too much length to the panels will make your neckline too big and the poncho will fall off your shoulders) as follows: Raised Chevron Piece: undo the last double crochet row of stitching you completed then join your yarn on the last repeat row of the Raised Chevron Panel and only work 1 more full row repeat. Then, work the double crochet row again and fasten off. Loopy st Piece: undo the final rows so that the loops are all free. Join your yarn to the last repeat row of the Loopy Chevron Panel and work as many 2 row repeats as necessary to match the new length of the Raised Chevron Panel. Then, rebraid where necessary, work the final rows again and fasten off.\nAnd/or: after the seaming is complete, add a couple extra rounds of half double crochet (round 2 of the edging instructions) before doing the final round of the edging to get a little extra around the body. Make sure that you have the correct stitch multiple when indicated.\nBottom Edging\nWith right side facing, join yarn with a slip st in the first st to the left of a corner at bottom edge of Poncho.\nRound 1: Ch 2 (does not count as a st here and throughout), * work in hdc evenly to corner, 3 hdc in corner st and mark center st of 3 hdc just made; repeat from * once more, join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2. Be sure to end up with an even number of sts along each of the 2 edges, including corner sts.\nRound 2: Ch 2, * hdc in each st to marked st, 3 hdc in marked st; repeat from * once more, hdc in last hdc, join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2.\nRound 3: Ch 1, * sc in next st, MD in next st; repeat from * around, join with slip st in first sc. Fasten off.\nDesigner Note: If you decided to make your panels a bit longer, you may need to work a few extra sts on the first round of the neck edging. Try to add as few sts as possible without puckering the fabric or creating large gaps. Keep track of how many extra sts you added, then place that many markers at top edge, evenly spaced around the neck. On the second row, simply skip all the marked sts to get back to the correct number of sts needed.\nShallow Cowl\nWith right side facing, join yarn with slip st anywhere along neck edge.\nRound 1 (right side): Ch 2 (does not count as a st here and throughout), 108 dc evenly around neck edge, join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2 \u2013 108 dc.\nRound 2: Ch 2, * bpdc around next st, fpdc around next st; repeat from * around, join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2.\nRound 3 (decrease round): Ch 2, *[bpdc around next st, fpdc around next st] 7 times, bpdc around next st, fpdc2tog over next 2 fpdc skipping the bpdc between them; repeat from * 5 more times, join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2 \u2013 96 sts,\nRounds 4-12: Repeat Round 2.\nRounds 13-16: Ch 1, sc in each st around, join with slip st in first sc.
