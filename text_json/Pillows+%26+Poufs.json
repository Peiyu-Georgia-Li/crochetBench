        "instructions": "Making this easy pillow is a great way to relax and focus on crochet while taking a break from the world. The result is a pillow that will add comfort in whatever room you use it.\n\nNotes:\n1. Pillow cover is made from two pieces. Both pieces are worked back and forth in rows with two strands of yarn held together throughout.\n2. Yarn color is changed to create stripes. To change color, work last stitch of old color to last yarn over. Yarn over with new color and draw through all loops on hook to complete stitch. Proceed with new color. Do not cut old color until instructed. Carry color not in use carefully up side edge when next needed.\n3. Fringe is attached to a ridge on front of the pillow cover and tassels are attached to all four corners.\n4. Keep pillow form handy. As you work, compare size of each of the two pieces with pillow form. If a piece is too large or too small, adjust the size by adding or subtracting the number of beginning chains and/or number of rows worked.\n\nSpecial Stitch:\nFpdc (Front post double crochet) = Yarn over, insert hook from front side of work to back and to front again around post of indicated stitch, yarn over and pull up a loop (3 loops on hook), [yarn over and draw through 2 loops on hook] twice. Skip the top of the stitch \"behind\" the Fpdc.\n\nPILLOW COVER PIECES (make 2):\nWith 2 strands of A held together, ch 42. \nRow 1 (right side): With A, working in back bumps only, dc in 4th ch from hook (3 skipped ch count as first dc), dc in each remaining ch across\u201440 dc. \nRow 2: With A, ch 2 (counts as first hdc here and throughout), turn, hdc in next st, Fpdc around each of next 36 sts, hdc in next st, hdc in top of beginning ch-3 and change to 2 strands of B held together\u20144 hdc and 36 post sts.\nRow 3: With B, ch 3, turn, dc in each st across, dc in top of beginning ch-2\u201440 dc.\nRow 4: With B, ch 2 (counts as first hdc here and throughout), turn, hdc in next st, Fpdc around each of next 36 sts, hdc in next st, hdc in top of beginning ch-3 and change to 2 strands of A held together.\nRow 5: With A, ch 3, turn, dc in each st across, dc in top of beginning ch-2.\nRows 6\u20139: Repeat Rows 2\u20135.\nRows 10\u201312: Repeat Rows 2\u20134.\nRows 13 and 14: With A, ch 3, turn, dc in each st across, dc in top of beginning ch-2 and change to 2 strands of B held together at the end of Row 14.\nRows 15 and 16: Repeat Rows 3 and 4. Place a marker in ridge just made on right side of piece (for tassel placement).\nRow 17: Repeat Row 5.\nRows 18\u201325: Repeat Rows 2\u20135 twice.\nRow 26: Repeat Row 2.\nFasten off A. Do not fasten off B.\n\nEdging Round: With B, ch 1, work sc stitches as evenly spaced as possible along all 4 sides of piece, working 3 sc in each corner. Take care to work the same number of sc along each side; join with slip st in first sc.\nFasten off.\n\nFINISHING:\nSeaming: Hold the two pieces together with stripes running in the same direction, stitches matching and wrong sides facing inwards. With right side facing you and with 2 strands of B held together, working in inner loops of both pieces at the same time, join yarn with slip st in any edging st, slip st in each remaining edging st all the way around, and insert pillow form before completing seam. Fasten off.\n\nFringe:\nCut 1 strand each of A, B, and C, each 5\" [12.5 cm] long. Fold strands in half to form a loop. Insert crochet hook from bottom through back most loop of first stitch in marked ridge on front of pillow cover. Place fold on hook and draw fold through, forming a loop. Thread ends of strands through loop and pull to tighten. Repeat to attach fringe in every other stitch across ridge. Trim ends evenly.\n\nTassels (make 4):\nHolding 1 strand each of A, B, and C together, wrap yarn about 10 times around 5\" (12.5 cm) piece of heavy cardboard. Thread a 10\" (25.5 cm) single strand of any of the yarn colors under the top of the wraps and tie into a tight knot for top of tassel. Do not trim the ends of the tie. Slip wraps off of cardboard. Tie a 10\" (25.5 cm) length of yarn around wraps about \u00be\" (19 mm) from top for tassel neck. Wrap ends of tie around wraps about 6 times and then draw ends to inside of tassel. Cut the lower ends of the wraps and trim to even. Use yarn needle and ends of tie at top of tassel to sew one tassel securely to each of the four corners.\n\nWeave in ends.",

Fasten off.\n\nNotes\n1. Hold two strands of A together throughout.\n2. Working with B:\n   a. The yarn is comprised of a strand of chenille and a strand of thread. Treat the yarn as if it were one strand; do not work into spaces between the chenille and thread. \n   b. Work with a slightly looser tension than with A.\n   c. Begin each wrong side row with a plain section of yarn, not at a cluster of loops (if necessary, cut off the first cluster before joining the yarn at the end of the previous row). When you reach a cluster, do not work into it or pull through a loop; instead, guide it to the right side of the fabric and continue to crochet with the plain sections of the strand.\n3. To change yarn at the end of a row or round, work last stitch of old yarn to last yarn over. Yarn over with new yarn and draw through all loops on hook to complete stitch. Proceed with new yarn. Cut old yarn.\n4. Catch the tails behind the stitching of the next row to minimize weaving in ends. Weaving in doesn\u2019t need to be too precise as all ends will be tucked into the wrong side of the pillow cover before the pillow form is inserted.\n5. If your buttons are sew-through style with holes, be sure to create a shank when sewing to the pillow cover so the fabric doesn\u2019t tug when buttoned.\n\nPILLOW COVER\nWith 2 strands of A held together, ch 37.\nRow 1 (right side): Hdc in 3rd ch from hook (beginning ch counts as first hdc) and in each ch across, turn\u201436 hdc.\nobtain the gauge.",
