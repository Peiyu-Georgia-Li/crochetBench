Test stitching on scrap fabric before working on your jacket.\n• Use a 90/14 or 100/16 machine needle for ease stitching into denim.\nWeave yarn tail along bottom of Sleeve in and out of Motifs to create a gathering st. \nPull yarn tail to gather and adjust width of Sleeve to match width of fabric cuff.\nSandwich bottom of crocheted Sleeve (approx ¼\" [.5 cm]) between fabric cuff opening, ensuring RS faces up for both pieces.

When sewing sides of coat, leave the last 2 side squares at the lower edge of the front and back unsewn for side slits.\n\nButton Band\nRow 1 (right side): With right side facing, join A with sc at beginning of left front edge, work sc evenly along the left front edge.\nRow 2: Ch 1, turn, sc in each st across.\nRepeat Row 2 until button band measures about 1½\" [4 cm]. Fasten off.\n\nButtonhole Band\nRow 1 (right side): With right side facing, join A with sc at beginning of right front edge, sc in each st to near top corner of first of upper four Granny Squares, [ch 3, sk next 3 sc (for buttonhole), sc in each st to near top corner of next Granny Square] 3 times, ch 3, sk next 3 sc, sc in each st to end of right front edge.\nRow 2: Ch 1, turn, sc in each sc and ch across.\nRow 3: Ch 1, turn, sc in each st across.\nRepeat Row 3 until buttonhole band measures about 1½\" [4 cm]. Fasten off.\n\nCollar\nRow 1 (right side): With right side facing, join A with sc at beginning of neck edge, work 79 more sc evenly spaced along neck edge—80 sc.\nRow 2: Ch 2 (counts as hdc here and throughout), turn, hdc2tog, hdc in each st across—79 hdc.\nRepeat Row 2 until collar measures about 6\" [15 cm]. Fasten off.\n\nSleeve Cuffs\nRound 1 (right side): With right side facing and beginning under the arm, join A with sc in sleeve edge, work 39 more sc evenly spaced around edge; join with slip st in first sc—40 sc.\nRound 2 (wrong side): Ch 2 (counts as first hdc here and throughout), turn, hdc in next sc, hdc2tog, *hdc in next 2 sc, hdc2tog; repeat from * around; join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2—30 hdc.\nRound 3: Ch 2, hdc in each st around; join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2.\nRepeat Round 3 until cuff measures about 5\" [12.5 cm]. Fasten off. Repeat around other sleeve edge. Fold cuff up.\n\nLower Edging\nWith right side facing, join A with sc in lower front corner, sc evenly spaced along entire lower edge (including side slits), working 2 sc in each lower corner of side slits.
