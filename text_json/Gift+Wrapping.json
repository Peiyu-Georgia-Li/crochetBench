Add or subtract chain stitches and rows as necessary to fit own container.\n\nNOTES This snowflake inspired gift wrapper is a fast & easy project designed to be used as both a decorative embellishment & a securing strap for food containers as well as jars. Snowflake motifs and strap band widths and color designs can be mixed and matched in a variety of ways. Furthermore, snowflakes can be made easily removable for use as a tree decoration by simply tying the motif onto the band, rather than sewing. Or leave the snowflake motif off entirely. To get a custom fit, plan your design using the dimension of your container & a gauge swatch. Using a tape measure wrapped all the way around the container or jar to be used record the measurement and subtract 1 - 2” (2.5 x 5.1 cm) to allow for negative ease. This will insure a tight fit. Determine the number of starting chains required based upon your gauge swatch & number of sts per inch compared to the container dimensions. Straps are worked in rows & overlapped about ½” (12.7 mm) (or more as needed) and seamed together. Band should fit tightly over the container to prevent slipping off and to aid in securing the food container top.\n\nFinished measurements Directions are given for Wrappers to fit a container with a 17½” (44.5 cm) circumference. Wrappers can be adjusted based on size of gift container. Snowflake Motif 1 = 4” (10 cm) in diameter, Snowflake Motif 2 = 3½” (9 cm) in diameter. RED HEART® Super Saver®, Art.

Secure the yarn ends neatly on wrong side of band. Wrap band tightly around gift container and pin ends, overlapping the rounded edge about ½” (1.3 cm) or more as needed. Sew through both layers neatly around the curved end to prevent puckers when band is stretched. Likewise, turn the band inside out and sew the loose opposite end to the underneath side of the band. Weave in ends. With matching color yarn, sew snowflake over the overlapped portion of the band or thread yarn through the band and the centered snowflake and tie on with a bow for easy removal for use as tree decoration. Alternatively, leave motif off, weave yarn along center and tie in small yarn bow.",
