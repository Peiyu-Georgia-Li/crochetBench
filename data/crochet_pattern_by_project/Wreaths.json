Fasten off, leaving long tail. Using long tail, attach each ear to top of Bunny head.\n\nEyes (make 2)\nCut 2 circles each of black and pink felt. Position black felt slightly off-center over top of pink felt. Glue black felt in place. Glue each assembled Eye to Bunny head.\n\nNose\nCut out a small triangle of pink felt.

If using a straw wreath, leave the plastic wrap on the wreath for easier wrapping.\n\nWREATH\nWith A, evenly wrap yarn around the entire wreath. Weave in a 3\u201d [7.6 cm] tail on the back.\n\nEggs\nWrap 5 eggs with colors B, C, D, E and F. Tightly wrap the eggs vertically around until the Styrofoam is covered. Weave in a 3\u201d [7.6 cm] tail on the back of the egg. When the wrapping is done, to keep yarn in place at the top and bottom of the egg, add a very small amount of white glue under the top strands of yarn.\n\nWreath Assembly\nInsert a stem wire through the back of each egg vertically. Attach the eggs to the wreath off center, in a row, with the stem wire by winding the stem wire around the wreath and twist tightly on the back to secure. Trim the wire and poke the loose ends into the wreath. Add some white glue under the eggs to secure them in place to the wreath.\n\nBunny\nWith A, make a 1\u201d [2.5 cm] pompom for the head and 2\u201d [5 cm] pompom for the body. Tie the head to the body.\n\nRuffle Collar\nWith G, ch loosely to fit around neck of Bunny. Row 1: Dc in 3rd ch from hook, *3 dc in next ch, rep from * across. Fasten off, leaving long tail.

Fasten off, leaving an 8\u201d [20 cm] tail. Using tail, sew flowers to wrapped Eggs. Weave tail in back of flower.\n\nLEAVES\nWith G, ch 7.\nRow 1: Sc in 2nd ch from hook, sc in next ch, hdc in next ch, dc in next ch, hdc in next ch, 3 sc in next ch, working in rem loops on opposite side of ch, hdc in first ch, dc in next ch, hdc in next ch, sc in next 2 chs, sl st in first st. Fasten off, leaving long tail. Using long tail, sew 1 Leaf to back of each Flower. Weave in loose ends.\n\nFINISHING\nBefore attaching the flowers, pin the flowers in place arranging different sizes and colors. This will allow you to decide what sizes, colors go well together. Once you have decided on your design take a digital picture for reference.\n\nAttach the flowers by sewing the back of the flower to the yarn wrapped on the eggs and wreath. Add a small amount of white glue to hold in place. Trim and weave in loose yarn.\n\nHanging Loop\nWith 2 strands A, ch 80, slip st in 80th ch from hook. Wrap the connected chain around the wreath and pull the front end through back end of the circle to make a hanging loop.\n\nBunny Attachment\nAttach Bunny to the wreath, behind the eggs by threading a stem wire through the body and then wrapping the stem wire around the wreath securely.
