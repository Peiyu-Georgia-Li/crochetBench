You may want less fullness if your fabric is heavier, or more depending on your personal style. \nCut Front and Back panels for Skirt. Sew side seams, leaving at least 2\" [5 cm] open at top of right side seam.\nGather skirt until it matches Chest measurement to fit pieces of Bodice. \nIf gathering with a sewing machine, decrease tension on your machine, and set machine to a long straight stitch. Pull a 6\" [15 cm] tail of thread from both the needle and the bobbin. Do not backstitch at start of row. Stitch a line approx \u00bc\" [0.5 cm] down from top of Skirt, breaking your sewing wherever you encounter a seam, ensuring that you leave long tails at both the start and stop of each new line of stitching. In same fashion, work an additional line \u00bc\" [0.5 cm] below your initial row of stitching. You will now have 2 rows of gathering stitches.\nThread tails from needle (indicated in black)\nBreak stitching at seam lines\nThread tails from bobbin (indicated in red)\nOnce all lines of stitching are complete, take the bobbin threads in one hand and pull gently to gather fabric. \n\nPull bobbin threads to gather \nYou will need to manipulate the ruffles to ensure gathers are distributed evenly. Once gathers are distributed evenly, pin to crochet sts worked in Skirt Joining Row with RS facing (seam allowance will fall along interior of dress.) Sew tog using a straight stitch, using a 5/8\" [1.6 cm] seam allowance. Ensure that Button and Buttonhole Bands are not captured in seam.\nSew Buttons to correspond with Buttonholes at side of dress. \n\nFinished measurements represent a skirt that is three times the fullness of the bodice measure. You may need to seam multiple panels together to achieve this width.",
