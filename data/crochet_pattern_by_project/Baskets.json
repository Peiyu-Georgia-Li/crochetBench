Change hook sizes, or actual st used, to get the correct color in place.

Make certain that the number of sc made in each individual color in the colorway is the same as in Inside Bottom. Unravel one st repeat (sc, ch 1). Leave remaining ch sts unworked, turn.\nWork in planned pooling Moss st same as Inside Bottom until piece measures 7\" (18 cm), ending after a right side row.

Align D rectangles so they are on outside of seam, as shown in frame diagram.\nUse markers to hold corners of C to corners where the sides meet.\nUsing cotton crochet thread, whip st around edges of C, securing it to the sides by pulling the cotton tight after each st.\nFINISHING\nSquish or stretch the sts on foundation ch of Inside Bottom piece to match the width of the rest of the piece. You can slide the sts around along the foundation ch, as with an adjustable ring. Unravel unused foundation ch sts and weave in yarn tail to secure foundation. Work foundation of Sides of Box piece the same.\nWith right sides facing together, pin top edge of Sides of Box piece to Inside Bottom piece. With B, whip st short edges of Sides together and continue sewing around perimeter of Inside Bottom. Pull the sts snug so they don\u2019t show through on right side.\nPlace Inside Bottom into the plastic canvas frame with wrong side down, matching up each corner. Using yarn needle and B, pass needle from outside of plastic frame up through a corner. Make sure the corner is in place, and pass the needle from inside the box back through to the outside, catching one st to secure the corner. From outside the plastic frame, pull the two ends of B tightly and tie a knot. Cut off the ends of the yarn, leaving a short tail. Don\u2019t worry about the tails, they will be covered by Outside Bottom piece. Secure remaining 3 corners and center of Inside Bottom the same.\nCarefully fold the sides of the box down over the plastic frame, easing the piece around the corners to avoid tearing the yarn.\nWith right sides facing out, pin Outside Bottom to foundation edge of Sides. With B, whip st around Outside Bottom to join to Sides of Box.\nWeave all loose ends to inside.",

Scarf: The scarf is longer than needed to reach around the basket, the ends are supposed to overlap. Before beginning, decide where you want the overlapping ends of the scarf to be. Carefully pin scarf in place around basket just above scalloped lower edge. When happy with the scarf placement, sew the top and lower edges to the basket leaving the overlapping ends loose. After edges of scarf are sewn to basket, gather the 9 sts of the first overlapping row on each overlapped end to make it look like the scarf ends have been tied together.
