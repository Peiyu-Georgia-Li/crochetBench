Crochet through the evenly spaced holes in the scalloped fabric strip.\nSpecial Stitches\nCh = insert hook from front to back through next hole, draw top edge through loop on hook.\nSlip st = insert hook in front loop of indicated chain or stitch and in next hole, draw top edge through chain or stitch and loop on hook.\nNotes \n1. Work into the holes at the top edge of the fabric strip. Always insert hook in hole from front to back of fabric.\n2. If you prefer to work from the center of the hank rather than the outer edge, slide the paper band to one end, remove the cardboard, and gently pull out the fabric.\n3. Prepare the fabric for stitching by trimming the cut edge in a curve. Begin cutting at the top edge before the first hole and end at the bottom edge below the 2nd hole.\n4. Always turn piece clockwise so that working fabric is behind stitches just made.\nSCARF\nFold fabric so first hole is placed over 2nd hole, insert hook in hole through both thicknesses, insert hook in next hole and draw top edge through loop on hook (slip knot made), ch 4.\nRow 1: Turn, working in front loops only, slip st in 2nd ch from hook and in each ch across, turn\u20143 slip sts.\nRow 2: Ch 1, working in front loops only, slip st in each st, turn.\nRepeat Row 2 until at least 5 (but no more than 8) holes remain.\nPlace last stitch on locking stitch marker or safety pin so stitch doesn\u2019t unravel as you prepare fabric for last row. Trim fabric so that only 5 holes remain. Cutting from outer edge, trim fabric to \u00bc\u201d (6.4 mm) under last 2 holes, then continue cutting on a curve ending at the bottom edge under the 3rd hole. Remove stitch holder and place loop back on hook.\nLast Row: Ch 1, working in front loops only, slip st in each st; insert hook in last hole and pull end tail through loop on hook. Tighten end tail until knot forms.\nFINISHING\nWeave in end.\nRHC0125-018701M | LAST UPDATED: AUGUST 1, 2019",

The yarn does the color changing for an amazing look! Pompoms add a modern fun finishing touch!\n\nNOTES\n1. This yarn has been specially designed to get 3 sc in each color in the sequence when worked in Moss st.\n2. Each color length, or 3 repeats, should measure about 1\u00bd\" (4 cm) across in Moss st. However, it is more important that you follow the per-color gauge than the per-inch gauge.\n\nMOSS STITCH\nCh an even number of sts.\nRow 1: Sk 3 ch, sc in next ch, * ch 1, sk 1 foundation ch, sc in next ch; repeat from * to end, turn.\nRow 2: Ch 2 (counts as a stitch now and throughout), sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end finishing with a sc in last ch-3 space, turn.\nRow 3: Ch 2 (counts as a stitch now and throughout), sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end finishing with a sc in last ch-2 space, turn.\nRepeat Row 3 only for Moss st.\n\nSCARF\nCh through 1 full color sequence, with the last loop on hook being the first loop of a new color just after a color change in the yarn.\nRow 1 (right side): Sk 2 ch (counts as a sc), sc in the 4th ch from hook, * ch 1, sc around the foundation ch (instead of going into a ch st); repeat from * until 1 full color sequence has been completed. The number of sc made in each individual color in the sequence should be 3. Leave remaining ch sts unworked. Undo one st repeat (sc, ch 1), turn.\nNote: If at this point you are NOT getting 3 sc per color, then redo the row with a different hook size. Getting 3 sc per color with this yarn is essential to making this technique work.\nRow 2 (wrong side): Ch 2 (counts as a sc now and throughout), sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end finishing with a sc in last ch-2 space, turn.\nNote: As you work this row and all remaining rows, you MUST get the correct number of sc in each color in order to maintain the planned color pooling.

It doesn\u2019t matter which direction the stitch shifts as long as it is off-set by 1.\nRow 4 (wrong side): Ch 2 (counts as a sc now and throughout), sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in the next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end, finishing with a sc in last ch-2 space, turn.\nNote: The color of the sts on this row will shift to the left or right by 1 st from the previous wrong side row depending on the colorway and if you are right or left handed.

        "instructions": "SPECIAL TERMS\nFsc: Foundation single crochet (This technique creates a foundation chain and a row of single crochet stitches in one) \u2013Step 1: Place a slip knot on hook, ch 2, insert hook in 2nd ch from hook and draw up a loop; yarn over and draw through one loop on hook (the \"chain\"); yarn over and draw through 2 loops on hook (the \"single crochet\").Step 2: The following stitch is worked under the forward 2 loops of the stem of the previous stitch (into the \"chain\"). Insert hook into the face of the \"chain\" and under the nub at the back of the \"chain\", draw up a loop, yarn over and draw through one loop on hook (the \"chain\"), yarn over and draw through 2 loops on hook (the \"single crochet\"). Repeat for the length of foundation.\nSPECIAL TECHNIQUE\nBroomstick Lace\u2014Broomstick lace is made with the use of a large gauge knitting needle (stick) to hold all the loops in a row. Then, using a crochet hook, the loops are held together in groups and worked off the stick with regular crochet stitches. This pattern uses groups of 5 loops, with 5 sc worked into each group. For this particular method of Broomstick technique, the stick is held to the left (for right-handed crocheters), and the two steps of this technique are made with RS facing. In the first step you may need to snug up each loop after slipping it to the stick in order to keep all the loops as even as possible, but do not tighten the loops too much. The row of loops on the stick should slide freely in order to be more easily worked off in the second step.\nNote: To slip a loop from the crochet hook to the stick, keep the loop seated in the same direction. That is, bring the hook to the tip of the stick, transfer the loop from the hook to the stick without twisting, so the strand that lies to the front of the hook ends up at the front of the stick.Loop Pass (RS): At the end of a regular crochet row, do not turn. With the stick to the left and the last row of crochet to the right, slip the last loop on hook onto the stick (counts as first loop). Moving from left to right, backwards across the row of regular crochet, skip first sc, *insert empty hook through back loop only of next sc, yarn over and draw up a loop long enough to fit over the stick. Slip the loop onto the stick as described above, without twisting; repeat from * across the row as directed, do not turn.Return Pass (RS): Insert empty hook from right to left in the first 5 loops on stick, keeping loops seated in same direction. Holding the 5 loops in a group and working the group as one, slide the group off the stick (5 loops on hook). Pick up the feeder yarn from the back of the row, bring yarn loosely up to the level of the hook, yarn over and draw a loop through the group of 5 loops on hook (one loop on hook), ch 1 to lock the edge (one loop on hook). This is the only place you will need to ch 1 before making a stitch. Working the group as one, work 5 sc in the same group. *Insert hook in next 5 loops on stick, slide group off the stick, 5 sc in group; repeat from * across row.\nSCARF\nNote: If you prefer to begin scarf (stole, throw) with a traditional foundation chain, work as follows: Ch 31 (71,171). Row 1: Sc in 2nd ch from hook and in each remaining ch across, turn\u201430 (70, 170) sc. Then proceed to Row 2 of instructions.Fsc 30 (70, 170).

Slip st = insert hook in front loop of indicated chain or stitch and in next hole, draw top edge through chain or stitch and loop on hook. Notes 1. Work into the holes at the top edge of the fabric strip. Always insert hook in hole from front to back of fabric. 2. If you prefer to work from the center of the hank rather than the outer edge, slide the paper band to one end, remove the cardboard, and gently pull out the fabric. 3. Prepare the fabric for stitching by trimming the cut edge in a curve. Begin cutting at the top edge before the first hole and end at the bottom edge below the 2nd hole. 4. Always turn piece clockwise so that working fabric is behind stitches just made. SCARF Fold fabric so first hole is placed over 2nd hole, insert hook in hole through both thicknesses, insert hook in next hole and draw top edge through loop on hook (slip knot made), ch 4.

Fasten off.\nWeave in ends. Block if desired to open yo-yos.\nSpecial Techniques\nAdjustable-ring method = Wrap yarn into a ring, ensuring that the tail falls behind the working yarn. Grip ring and tail firmly between middle finger and thumb. Insert hook through center of ring, yarn over (with working yarn) and draw up a loop. Work stitches of first round in the ring, working over both strands (the tail and the ring). After the first round of stitches is worked, pull gently, but firmly, on tail to tighten ring.\nJoin with sc = Place a slip knot on hook, insert hook in indicated stitch, yarn over and draw up a loop, yarn over and draw through both loops on hook.\nNotes\n1. Scarf is made from 210 yo-yos arranged in 20 rows.\n2. First row has 20 yo-yos. Each succeeding row decreases by 1 yo-yo from the previous row to last row of 1 yo-yo.\n3. All yo-yos are worked with right side facing.\n4. Yo-yos are joined to neighboring yo-yos in a \u201cjoin as you go\u201d technique with wrong sides held together. Refer to Assembly Diagram for placement of joining stitches.\nSCARF\nRow 1\nYo-yo #1: Make an adjustable ring, ch 2 (does not count as dc here or throughout), 12 dc in ring; join with slip st in top of beginning ch\u201412 dc.
