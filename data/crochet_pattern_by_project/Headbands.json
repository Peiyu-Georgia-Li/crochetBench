You can make matching curlicue hair bows for pig tails. If you want a longer curlicue just plan to do the double crochets over a few more chain stitches.

Fasten off leaving a yarn tail of about 10\". \nThread the yarn tail into the yarn needle and sew the ends of the first and last rows together, being careful that the strip is not twisted. \nFor a little more pizzazz: \n\u2022 weave one or two strands of contrasting color yarn through the strip: over 2 rows, under 2 rows and repeat around the headband. \n\u2022 With sewing needle and thread, sew sequins or beads to the crown area that will show most when worn. \n \nThe versatile Strip is so easy that you'll want to make more cool stuff.

Fasten off leaving a 10\" yarn tail. \nThread the yarn tail into the yarn needle and sew the ends of the first and last rows together, being careful that the strip is not twisted. \nJazz up your wristband with weaving yarn strands, sewing sequins, beads, or charms \u2013 see Headband. \n \nBELT \nMake the Basic Strip approximately 36\" long. Check to see that it will fit comfortably around the waist and still have 6-8\" of strip on each side of where you tie it before fastening off. Fasten off. Weave in ends. \nAdd fringe to each end of the belt: cut twelve 6\" pieces of yarn \u2013 these can be the same color as your belt or any other color you like. Holding 2 pieces together, fold them in half, forming a loop. Insert your crochet hook through one of the stitches at the end of the belt and draw the loop through the fabric, then draw the cut ends through the loop and pull to tighten. Repeat in each stitch on each end of the belt. Trim the fringe so that all the cut ends are even. \n \nFeeling adventurous? Here's another way to make a belt: Make a chain that is 36\" long. Then work Basic Strip Row 1 and Row 2 across the chain, then work Row 2 once more and fasten off. And of course you can work it all in the same color or change colors every row! Add beads, fringe, ribbon or whatever suits your mood. \n \nRED HEART\u00ae 'Kids\u2122', Art. E711 (5 ounce/290 yard solid color; 4 ounce/232 yard multi color skein.",
