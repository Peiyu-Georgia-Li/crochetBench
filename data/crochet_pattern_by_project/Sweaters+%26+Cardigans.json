        "instructions": "NOTES\n1. You may have to tighten or loosen some stitches as you go in order to keep the color pooling intact. Keep a variety of hook sizes on hand to help resize your stitches.\n2. Different dye lots of the same colorway may change the number of stitches obtained in any given color. Count the number of stitches YOU get to work through one full sequence, as well as in each color section, and maintain that throughout the pattern.\n3. Pullover is made from two main pieces: Front and Back. Both pieces begin with a Color-Pooled Center Panel. Stitches are worked along both long side edges of the Center Panel to begin Side Panels. It is important that you maintain the width throughout the Side Panel as established by the length of the Center Panel. It is easy to accidentally tighten up the stitches on the Side Panel so be aware.\n4. Gauge is not critical because the entire piece is made by measurements, so it can be adjusted to fit any size. Center Panel of model is about 10\" (25.5 cm) wide. But, if your Center Panel width differs, the width of the Pullover can be adjusted as you make the Side Panels.\n\nMOSS STITCH\nCh an even number of sts.\nRow 1: Skip 3 ch, sc in next ch, * ch 1, skip 1 foundation ch, sc in next ch; repeat from * to end, turn.\nRow 2: Ch 2 (counts as a stitch now and throughout), sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end finishing with a sc in last ch-3  space, turn.\nRow 3: Ch 2 (counts as a stitch now and throughout), sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end finishing with a sc in last ch-2  space, turn.\nRepeat Row 3 only for Moss st.\n\nFRONT\nColor-Pooled Center Panel\nWith A, ch through at least one full color sequence, with the last loop on hook being the first loop of a new color just after a color change in the yarn.\nRow 1 (right side): Skip 3 ch, sc in the 4th ch from the hook, * ch 1, skip next ch, sc in next ch repeat from * until 1 full color sequence has been completed on this row. Leave remaining ch sts unworked. Count the number of sc made in each color. Undo one st repeat (sc, ch 1), turn.\nRow 2 (wrong side): Ch 2 (counts as a stitch now and throughout), sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end finishing with a sc in last ch-3 space, turn. Note: As you work this row and all remaining rows, you MUST get the correct color st in the correct place in order to maintain the planned color pooling. Change hook sizes, or actual st used, to get the correct color in place. If you use the same number of sts per color that you counted on Row 1, it will work out.\nRow 3 (right side): Ch 2 (counts as a stitch now and throughout), sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in the next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end, finishing with a sc in last ch-2 space, turn. The color of the sts on this row will shift to the left by 1 st from the previous right side row if right handed; it will shift to the right by 1 st if left handed.\nRow 4 (wrong side): Ch 2, sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in the next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end, finishing with a sc in last ch-2 space, turn. The color of the sts on this row will shift to the left by 1 st from the previous wrong side row if right handed; it will shift to the right by 1 st if left handed. Repeat Rows 3 and 4 until Panel measures about 24\" (61 cm).\nFasten off. Undo any extra foundation chains that were left unworked at the end of Row 1.\nIf your Center Panel does not measure 10\" (25.5 cm) wide, calculate the width for the Side Panels to buttonholes as follows: Measure the width of the Center Panel. Subtract the width of the Center Panel from 20 (24, 28)\" (51 (61, 71) cm) and then divide the result by 2, rounding up to nearest \u00bd\" (13 mm).\nExample: If the Center Panel is 12\" (30.5 cm) wide and you are making a size L/1X Pullover:\n1. Subtract 12\" from 24\": 24 \u2013 12 = 12\"\n2. Divide the result by 2: 12 / 2 = 6\"\nFirst Side Panel\nWith right side facing and working across one long side edge of Center Panel, join C with slip st in corner at beginning of long edge, this will be a top corner.\nRow 1 (right side): Ch 1, work sc evenly spaced all the way across long side edge. Make sure that you have an even number of sc sts, turn.\nRow 2: Ch 2 (counts as a stitch now and throughout), skip first sc, sc in next sc, * ch 1, skip next sc, sc in next sc; repeat from * to end, turn.\nRow 3: Ch 2, sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 1, sc in next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end finishing with a sc in last ch-2 space, turn.\nRepeat Row 3 only until Side Panel measures 5 (7, 9)\" (12.5 (18, 23) cm) or the width calculated above, end with a right side row (at the bottom of the Pullover).\nButtonhole Row (wrong side): Ch 2, sc in next ch-1 space, * ch 2 (for buttonhole), sc in next ch-1 space, [ch 1, sc in next ch-1 space] 3 times; repeat from * 4 more times, ** ch 1, sc in next ch-1 space; repeat from ** to end finishing with a sc in last ch-2 space, turn.\nNext Row: Repeat Row 3 working only 1 sc in each ch-2 buttonhole space.\nNext 3 Rows: Repeat Row 3 three times.\nShape Sleeve\nPlace a marker in the ch-1 space at center of last row worked. Note: If there is not an exact center ch-1 space, place marker in the ch-1 space as close to center as possible but slightly closer to top edge.\nRow 1 (right side): Ch 2, sc in next ch-1 space, *ch 1, sc in next ch-1 space; repeat from * working last sc in marked ch-1 space, remove marker, turn; leave remaining ch-1 spaces unworked.\nRow 2: Ch 1 (does not count as a st), sc in next ch-1 space, *ch 1, sc in next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end finishing with sc in last ch-2 space, turn.\nRow 3: Ch 2, sc in next ch-1 space, *ch 1, sc in next ch-1 space; repeat from * to last sc; do not work into the turning ch-1, turn.\nRow 4: Ch 1 (does not count as a st), sc in next ch-1 space, *ch 1, sc in next ch-1 space; repeat from * to end finishing with sc in last ch-2 space, turn.\nRows 5-10: Repeat Rows 3 and 4 three more times.\nFasten off.\nSecond Side Panel\nWith right facing and working across remaining long side edge of Center Panel, join C with slip st in corner at beginning of long edge, this will be a bottom corner.\nRow 1 (right side): Ch 1, work sc evenly spaced all the way across long side edge. Make sure that you have the same number of sts as in Row 1 of First Side Panel, turn.\nWork same as First Side Panel until this Side Panel measures about the same width to buttonholes, end with a wrong side row (at the bottom of the Pullover).\nBeginning with the Buttonhole Row (worked on a right side row, complete same as First Side Panel. Note: When working Second Side Panel, the buttonhole row will be a right side row and first row of sleeve will be a wrong side row, so that the buttonholes are formed on lower half of piece and sleeve is worked on upper half of piece.\nDo not fasten off and do not turn at the end of Row 10 of Sleeve.\nEdging\nRound 1 (right side): Ch 1, beginning across top edge, work sc evenly spaced all the way around outer edges of Front; join with slip st in first sc.\nFasten off.\nBACK\nMake same as Front, omitting buttonholes in Side Panels by working Buttonhole Row same as Row 3.\nFINISHING\nHold Front and Back with right sides facing together and stitches matching. Whipstitch shoulder seams, beginning at outer edge and sewing towards center, leaving 8\u201311\" (20.5\u201328 cm) at center unsewn for neck opening. Note: Select size of neck opening based on desired cowl tightness.\nWeave in ends. Turn Pullover right side out.\nCowl\nWith right side of Front facing, draw up a loop of B in neck edge at left seam.\nRow 1 (right side): Ch 1, work sc evenly spaced around neck edge; do not join. Cowl ribbing is now worked back and forth in rows perpendicular to the neck opening.\nRow 2: Ch 31, sc in 2nd ch from hook and in next 29 ch, slip st in each of first 2 sc of Row 1, turn\u201430 sc.\nRow 3 (buttonhole row): Ch 1, working in back loops only of Row 2 sts, sc in next 3 sc, *ch 1 (for buttonhole), skip next sc, sc in next 5 sc; repeat from * to last 3 sc, ch 1 (for buttonhole), skip next sc, sc in last 2 sc, turn\u201425 sc and 5 ch-1 buttonholes.\nRow 4: Ch 1, working in back loops only of previous row, sc in each sc and ch-1 space across, slip st in next 2 sc of Row 1, turn\u201430 sc.\nRow 5: Ch 1, working in back loops only of previous row, sc in each st across, turn.\nRepeat Rows 4 and 5 until all sts of Row 1 have been worked into, end with a Row 5.\nFasten off.\nPlace stitch markers on inside of Back in the locations opposite buttonholes of Front. Sew larger buttons to marked locations. Repeat this process to sew smaller buttons to cowl.\nWeave in any remaining ends.",

If you need to work another round to achieve the correct measurement for your size, do so now, before seaming. Sew Shoulder Seams Thread yarn needle with length of yarn approx twice the length of top of Sleeve. With Right Side (RS) facing, align stitches along top of Sleeve. Working through both the front and back of Sleeve, join yarn through corner ch-2 sp of front of Sleeve and corresponding corner ch-2 sp of back of Sleeve. Insert needle through top of next dc at front and corresponding dc at back. Pull yarn through to join. Keep a nice, relaxed tension on the sewing yarn making sure not to pull too tightly as this will cause the seam to pucker. Continue (Cont) in this manner, inserting needle through corresponding sts and ch-1 sps at front and back of Sleeve, to end of shoulder seam. Work through last corner ch-2 sp and fasten off, leaving a length to weave in end. Weave in end by inserting needle down through stitches and through bottom loops of dc on WS of work. Align left and right sides at center back. Thread yarn needle with length of yarn approximately 2 times length of back seam and join sides together through both top corner ch-2 sps. ( Note: These will be the same ch-2 sps on either side where shoulder seam was worked). Sew center back seam using Whipstitch as for Shoulder. Fasten off at bottom ch-2 sp. See diagram on page 7.

If too much color is left at end of rnd, pull back some stitches (sts) and slightly loosen gauge to re-work sts and finish at color change. If too little color is left, pull back some sts and slightly tighten gauge to re-work sts and finish at color change.\n\u2022 When Motif is complete, cut yarn where Color 5 (longest color rep) ends, leaving a tail for weaving in. Begin next Motif with Color 1 and repeat 5 rnds for each Motif.\n\nCLASSIC GRANNY A\nSize XS/S/M/L - make 15.\nSize XL/2/3XL - make 16.\nNotes:\n\u2022 Ch 3 at beg of rnd counts as dc.\n\u2022 Ch 6 at beg of rnds counts as dc and ch-3 sp.\n\u2022 Join all rnds with sl st to 3rd ch of ch-6 unless otherwise indicated.\nUsing Contrast A, with larger hook and Color 1, ch 4.

Note folded Motifs on side seams of Body will leave a 24\" [61 cm] square total armhole opening for sleeves on each side (see shaded sections on diagram for square armhole sleeve placement).\n\nAll Sizes: Join Motifs: Hold RS of 2 Motifs facing each other with sts aligned. With larger hook, join D (black) with sl st in ch-2 corners of aligned Motifs at top right. With RS facing each other, following diagrams, join Motifs, matching lettered sides and working rows of sl st loosely through both thicknesses. Fasten off.\n\nSleeve Edging: 1st row: (RS). With smaller hook, join D with sl st in lower edge of Sleeve and work 38 sc evenly across. Turn.\n2nd to 6th rows: Ch 1. 1 sc in each sc to end of row. Turn.\nFasten off. Sew sides of Edging tog.\nLower Edging: 1st row: (RS). With smaller hook, join D with sl st in lower edge of Left Front corner and work sc evenly across lower edge to corner of Right Front. Turn.\n2nd to 6th rows: Ch 1. 1 sc in each sc to end of row. Turn.\nFasten off.\nCollar and Front Band: 1st row: (RS). With smaller hook, join D with sl st in lower edge of Right Front and work sc evenly up Right Front, across back neck and down Left Front. Turn.\n2nd row: Ch 2 ( does not count as hdc). 1 hdc in each sc to end of row. Turn.\n3rd row: Ch 2. Working into horizontal loop lying below next st (see diagram), work 1 hdc in each hdc to end of row. Turn.\nRep last row until Collar and Front Band measures 6\" [15 cm]. Fasten off.",

When seaming, use same color yarn as garment to create a nearly invisible seam.\nThread yarn needle with length of D approx twice the length of top of Sleeve.\nSew shoulder seam using Whipstitch as follows: With RS facing, align stitches along top of Sleeve. Working through both front and back of Sleeve, join yarn through corner ch-2 sp of front and corresponding corner ch-2 sp of back.\nInsert needle through top of next dc at front and corresponding dc at back. Pull yarn through to join. Keep a nice, relaxed tension on the sewing yarn making sure not to pull too tightly as this will cause the seam to pucker.\nContinue in this manner, inserting needle through corresponding sts and ch-1 sps at front and back of Sleeve, until end of shoulder seam.\n\nCENTER BACK SEAM\nAlign left and right sides at center back. Thread yarn needle with length of D approx twice the length of back seam and join sides together through both top corner ch-2 sps.

Slip stitch the rows together using the following method: insert your hook (from front to back) into the front loop of the first st of Row 1, insert your hook (from back to front) into the back loop of the first st of the last row, yo and pull thru all loops on your hook. Continue in this way across the ribbed cuff to complete the seam.\nFasten off.\nSeaming\nTip: Use stitch markers to help line up your work and hold it in place while seaming. First, Seam Shoulders: Line up the last rows of the front and back panels and seam the shoulders of the front panel to the coordinating stitches of the back panel using the mattress stitch. Next, Attach Sleeves: Find center of the first row of a sleeve and line it up with the shoulder seam. Attach Row 1 of the sleeve to the sweater using the mattress stitch. Lastly, Seam Sleeves & Sides: Beginning nearest the ribbed cuff of a sleeve, seam the sleeve and side of sweater until you reach the top of the slip stitch edging of the front panel.\nCowl Neck\nWith 5 mm [US H-8] hook, join yarn with slip st on the WS of center back of neck, ch 1, work 96 (98,102, 106, 112, 118) sc around neck opening.

Turn. Slip st in back loop of each st across. \nRow 3: Ch 1. Turn. Extended sc in back loop of each slip st to last, sc2tog in last slip st and next sc on neck.\nRepeat Rows 2 \u2013 3 around neck, end with Row 3.\nDo not fasten off. \nCowl Neck Seam\nWith the RS of the cowl neck facing you bring the first row up to meet the last row. Position your working yarn so that it's on the inside of the cowl. Slip stitch the rows together using the following method: insert your hook (from front to back) into the front loop of the first st of Row 1, insert your hook (from back to front) into the back loop of the first st of the last row, yo and pull thru all loops on your hook. Continue in this way across to complete the seam. Fasten off.\nWeave in all ends. \nNote from Marly: I would like to thank Jennifer Pionk for her contribution to the Chic Sheep by Marly Bird\u2122 collection.

NOTES \u2022 Cardigan is comprised of 2 Hexagons which are folded and seamed along the top of Sleeve and the center back. \u2022 Hexagon shape will be quite wavy and will not lay flat once it begins to grow. Do not worry if your piece does not lay flat before folding! Trust the process! DETERMINING YOUR SIZE Click here to learn how to take proper measurements for the best fit. GAUGE SWATCH To make a Granny Square swatch as follows: See Diagram and Image on page 5. With A, chain (ch) 4. Join with slip stitch (sl st) to first ch to form ring. 1st round (rnd): Ch 6. [3 double crochet (dc) in ring. Ch 3] 3 times. 2 dc in ring. Join with sl st to 3rd ch of beg ch 6. 2nd rnd: Sl st in ch-3 space (sp). Ch 6. 3 dc in same ch-3 sp. *Ch 1. (3 dc. Ch 3. 3 dc) in next ch-3 sp. Repeat (Rep) from * twice. Ch 1. 2 dc in first ch-3 sp. Join with sl st to 3rd ch of beg ch 6. 3rd rnd: Sl st in ch-3 sp. Ch 6. 3 dc in same ch-3 sp. *Ch 1. 3 dc in next ch-1 sp. Ch 1. (3 dc. Ch 3. 3 dc) in next ch-3 sp. Rep from * twice more. Ch 1. 3 dc in last ch-1 sp. Ch 1. 2 dc in first ch-3 sp. Join with sl st to 3rd ch of beg ch 6. 4th rnd: Sl st in ch-3 sp. Ch 6. 3 dc in same ch-2 sp. *(Ch 1. 3 dc) in each ch-1 sp across to next ch-3 sp. Ch 1. (3 dc. Ch 3. 3 dc) in next ch-3 sp. Rep from * twice. (Ch 1. 3 dc) in each ch-1 sp across to next ch-3 sp. Ch 1. 2 dc in first ch-3 sp. Join. Rep last rnd twice more, for a total of 6 rounds (rnds). Lay Square flat and measure from the center of the Square to the top of the last round. These 6 rounds should measure 4\" [10 cm]. If it is slightly less than 4\" [10 cm], giving the Square a bit of a tug to \u2018open up\u2019 the stitches may help to achieve gauge. If it measures 3\u00bd\" [9 cm] or less, go up a hook size or 2 and work another gauge swatch. HEXAGON (Make 2) See Diagram on page 9. Slip Knot Make a loop with yarn and fold it on itself to make a pretzel shape. Then draw through to make slip knot. Chain (ch) 4. Yarn over hook (Yoh), draw through loop \u2013 1 chain made. Repeat last step until 4 chains made. Join with slip stitch (sl st) to form ring. 1st round (rnd): Ch 3 [counts as double crochet (dc)]. 2 dc in ring. Ch 2. (3 dc. Ch 2) 5 times in ring. Join with sl st to top of ch 3 \u2013 6 groups of 3 dc and 6 ch-2 spaces (sps). 2nd rnd: Sl st in each of next 2 dc to corner ch-2 sp. Ch 3 (counts as dc). (2 dc.

Rep last rnd, noting 1 more 3-dc cluster will be worked between corners on subsequent rnds until you have worked 16 (18-22-24) rnds worked in total. FOLD INTO SHAPE Fold Hexagon as shown in diagram, to create upside down L shape: Measure from Center Back to side as shown in diagram. If you need to work another round to achieve the correct measurement for your size, do so now, before seaming. SEW SHOULDER SEAMS Thread yarn needle with length of yarn approx twice the length of top of Sleeve. With Right Side (RS) facing, align stitches along top of Sleeve. Working through both the front and back of Sleeve, join yarn through corner ch-2 sp of front of Sleeve and corresponding corner ch-2 sp of back of Sleeve. Insert needle through top of next dc at front and corresponding dc at back. Pull yarn through to join. Keep a nice, relaxed tension on the sewing yarn making sure not to pull too tightly as this will cause the seam to pucker. Continue (Cont) in this manner, inserting needle through corresponding sts and ch-1 sps at front and back of Sleeve, to end of shoulder seam. Work through last corner ch-2 sp and fasten off, leaving a length to weave in end. Weave in end by inserting needle down through stitches and through bottom loops of dc on WS of work. CENTER BACK SEAM Align left and right sides at center back. Thread yarn needle with length of yarn approximately 2 times length of back seam and join sides together through both top corner ch-2 sps. Sew center back seam using whipstitch as for Shoulder. Fasten off at bottom ch-2 sp. HOOD See diagram on page 15. Place marker (PM) in 8th ch-1 sp from center back seam on both Right and Left Fronts.
