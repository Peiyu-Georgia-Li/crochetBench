Step 2: Yarn over, insert hook into the \"chain\" of the previous stitch and draw up a loop, yarn over and draw through one loop on hook (the \"chain\"), yarn over and draw through 3 loops on hook (the \"half double crochet\"). Repeat step 2 for the length of foundation. First-dc: First double crochet in a row (instead of a traditional ch 3) \u2013 Ch 1, sc in first st, ch 2. Note: If preferred, you may work a traditional ch-3 turning ch to serve as the first dc in a row. First-tr: First treble crochet in a row (instead of a traditional ch 4) \u2013 Ch 1, sc in first st, ch 3. Note: If preferred, you may work a traditional ch-4 turning ch to serve as the first tr in a row.

Repeat Rows 1\u20134 for Lace Diamond pattern. NOTE Diamond Lace stretches and opens up when blocked and worn. Take care to stretch fabric gently when measuring, to simulate the blocked lace. This is particularly important when measuring sleeves. BACK Note: If you prefer to begin piece with a traditional foundation chain, instead of Fhdc, work as follows: Ch 68 (80, 86, 92, 104, 110, 122, 128, 132). Foundation Row: Hdc in 2nd ch from hook and in each remaining ch across, turn\u201467 (79, 85, 91, 103, 109, 121, 127, 133) sts. Then proceed to Row 1 of instructions.

Row 1 (set up for Lace Diamond pattern): First-dc, ch 2, sk next st, *sc in next 3 sts, ch 5, sk next 3 sts; repeat from * across to last 5 sts, sc in next 3 sts, ch 2, sk next st, dc in last st, turn\u201411 (13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22) pattern repeats. Note: A pattern repeat consists of a single 'diamond' of the Lace Diamond pattern. The diamonds will become more evident after the first 4 rows of the Lace Diamond pattern are worked. Beginning with Row 1, work Lace Diamond pattern until back measures about 28 (28, 28, 29, 29, 29, 29, 30, 30)\"/71 (71, 71, 73.5, 73.5, 73.5, 73.5, 76, 76)cm when slightly stretched (to open up lace), end with a Row 3 of the Lace Diamond pattern. Fasten off. FRONT (make 2) Note: If you prefer to begin piece with a traditional foundation chain, instead of Fhdc, work as follows: Ch 44 (50, 50, 56, 62, 62, 68, 74, 74). Foundation Row: Hdc in 2nd ch from hook and in each remaining ch across, turn\u201443 (49, 49, 55, 61, 61, 67, 73, 73). Then proceed to Row 1 of instructions. Fhdc 43 (49, 49, 55, 61, 61, 67, 73, 73). Row 1: First-dc, ch 2, sk next st, *sc in next 3 sts, ch 5, sk next 3 sts; repeat from * across to last 5 sts, sc in next 3 sts, ch 2, sk next st, dc in last st, turn\u20147 (8, 8, 9, 10, 10, 11, 12, 12) pattern repeats. Beginning with Row 1, work Lace Diamond pattern until front measures same as back when slightly stretched, end with a Row 3 of the Lace Diamond pattern. Fasten off. SLEEVE (make 2) Note: If you prefer to begin piece with a traditional foundation chain, instead of Fhdc, work as follows: Ch 62 (62, 68, 68, 74, 74, 80, 80, 86). Foundation Row: Hdc in 2nd ch from hook and in each remaining ch across, turn\u201461 (61, 67, 67, 73, 73, 79, 79, 85) sts. Then proceed to Row 1 of instructions. Fhdc 61 (61, 67, 67, 73, 73, 79, 79, 85). Row 1: First-dc, ch 2, sk next st, *sc in next 3 sts, ch 5, sk next 3 sts; repeat from * across to last 5 sts, sc in next 3 sts, ch 2, sk next st, dc in last st, turn\u201410 (10, 11, 11, 12, 12, 13, 13, 14) pattern repeats.

Fasten off. Note: Length of sleeve provides for a 3-4\"/7.5-10cm cuff (to be folded back). If no cuff is desired, work each sleeve until it measures about 3-4\"/7.5-10cm less than the measurements given. FINISHING Using yarn needle, weave in all ends. Block pieces to schematic measurements. Beginning at side edge, sew shoulder seams, sewing for about 5 (6, 6 1/2, 7, 8, 8 1/2, 10, 10 1/2, 11)\"/12.5 (15, 16.5, 18, 20.5, 21.5, 25.5, 26.5, 28)cm, leaving about 6 (6 1/2, 7, 7 1/2, 8, 8 1/2, 8 1/2, 9, 9 1/2)\"/15 (16.5, 18, 19, 20.5, 21.5, 21.5, 23, 24)cm unsewn across back neck. Place top of each sleeve across one side edge, centered over shoulder seam, and sew in place. Sew side and sleeve seams. Hood With WS facing, join yarn with sc at beginning of front neck edge, work 67 (73, 73, 79, 85, 85, 85, 91, 91) sc evenly spaced around neck edge. Row 1: First-dc, ch 2, sk next st, *sc in next 3 sts, ch 5, sk next 3 sts; repeat from * across to last 5 sts, sc in next 3 sts, ch 2, sk next st, dc in last st, turn\u201411 (12, 12, 13, 14, 14, 14, 15, 15) pattern repeats. Beginning with Row 1, work Lace Diamond pattern until hood measures about 12\"/30.5cm when slightly stretched, end with a Row 3 of the Lace Diamond pattern. Fasten off. Block hood. Fold last row in half and seam for top of hood. Front Edging: With RS facing, join yarn with sc in lower front corner, sc evenly spaced up front edge, around front hood edge, and down opposite front edge. Fasten off. Sleeve Edging: With WS facing, join yarn with sc in sleeve seam, sc evenly spaced around sleeve edge; join with sl st in first sc. Fasten off. Repeat around 2nd sleeve. Note: Sleeve edging is worked with WS facing, so that the RS of the edging will show when the cuff is folded back. If length for the cuff was omitted, work the sleeve edging with the RS facing.",

PLACE MOTIFS \u2022 Lay Top on a flat surface, with a piece of cardboard or a thin book inserted to keep Front and Back separated while pinning and sewing Motifs into place. \u2022 Arrange Motifs as desired onto Top. Once you are happy with their placement, use straight pins to keep them in place. \u2022 You may use lengths of Caron\u00ae Colorama Bamboo Blend\u2122 in the same shade as the Motif to sew them onto the top, but to reduce weight and bulk, it is recommended to use Coats & Clark\u00ae Dual Duty XP all-purpose thread. The shade does not have to match exactly, as most of the stitches will be well hidden, but it is good to match thread color to the Motifs if and as best you can. \u2022 Using a running stitch, attach Motifs by sewing directly beneath the top loops of the last rnd and securing on the WS of the Top. \u2022 Be sure not to pull too tightly, checking often to make sure the fabric of the Top lays flat and that you are only sewing through the Front layer.",

Each end of fabric collar is secured by backstitching, which can be tricky to get into. Start about 1\" [2.5 cm] away from end of collar stand, picking apart enough stitches to fit stitch ripper into seam.\nAfter fabric collar has been removed, tidy it up by getting rid of any broken threads left in the fabric. With the inside of shirt facing up, place crocheted Collar between front and back pieces of shirt collar stand, with RS facing you and approx \u00bd\" [1.25 cm] of crocheted Collar down from top edge of stand. Pin Collar into place, making sure everything is nice and flat and ends of crocheted Collar are positioned where the original collar was.\nUsing the stitching holes of the original seam as a guide, sew Collar into place with sewing machine through all thicknesses. For best results, sew this seam with inside of shirt facing up, going slowly to ensure a nice tidy seam.",
