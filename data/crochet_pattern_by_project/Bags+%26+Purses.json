Every few rounds, you will be instructed to work one uncounted stitch at the beginning of the round. The purpose of this is to shift the location of the beginning of rounds slightly to the left. After working the uncounted stitch, the next stitch becomes the 1st st of round.\n\nLarge Eye Circle (Make 2)\nRound 1: With B make an adjustable loop, 6 sc in loop, pull beginning yarn tail to tighten loop, do not join -6sts.\nRound 2: 2 sc in each st around \u2013 12 sc.\nRound 3: [Sc in next st, 2 sc in next st] 6 times \u2013 18 sc.\nRound 4: [2 hdc in next st, 1 hdc in next st] 9 times, slip st in next st to join \u2013 27 hdc.

At end of last round, slip st in next st. Fasten off leaving a sewing length. With sewing length and yarn needle whipstitch Small Eye Circle onto center of Large Eye Circle.\n\nPupils (Make 2)\nRow 1: With A, make an adjustable loop, work 9 hdc in loop, pull beginning yarn tail to tighten loop. Do not join, but leave a little wedge of space between first and last hdc of round. Fasten off leaving a sewing length. With sewing length and yarn needle whipstitch Pupils to center of Small Eye Circle.\n\nBody\nWith A ch 11.\nRound 1: Working in bottom loops of ch sts, sc in 2nd ch from hook, sc in each of next 9 ch. Do not join. Work in a spiral. Mark beginning of round, moving marker up as work progresses.\nRound 2: Continuing around to other side of foundation chain (rotate work clockwise 180 degrees), 2 sc in same ch, sc in each of next 8 ch, 2 sc in next ch, (rotating work again in the same way and remembering to skip the turning chain from Round 1), 2 sc in next st, sc in each of next 8 sts, 2 sc in next st \u2013 24 sc.\nRound 3: [2 sc in next st, sc in each of next 10 sts, 2 sc in next st] twice -28 sts.\nRound 4: Sc in next st (uncounted st used to shift beginning of round; the next st counts as the first st of this round), [2 sc in the next st, sc in each of next 12 sts, 2 sc in the next st] twice \u2013 32 sc.\nRound 5: [2 sc in next st, sc in each of next 14 sts, 2 sc in next st] twice \u2013 36 sc.\nRound 6: [2 sc in next st, sc in each of next 16 sts, 2 sc in next st] twice \u2013 40 sc.\nRound 7: Sc in next st (uncounted st used to shift beginning of round; the next st counts as the first st of this round), [2 sc in next st, sc in each of next 18 sts, 2 sc in next st] twice \u2013 44 sc.\nRounds 8-14: Sc in each st around \u2013 44 sts.\nRound 15: Sc in next st (uncounted st used to shift beginning of round; the next st counts as the first st of this round), [sc2tog over next 2 sts, sc in each of next 18 sts, sc2tog over next 2 sts] twice \u2013 40 sc.\nRound 16: Sc in each st around \u2013 40 sts.\nRound 17: [Sc2tog over next 2 sts, sc in each of next 16 sts, sc2tog over next 2 sts] twice \u2013 36 sc.\nRound 18: Sc in each st around -36 sts.\nRound 19: [Sc2tog over next 2 sts, sc in each of next 14 sts, sc2tog over next 2 sts] twice \u2013 32 sc.

Work in a spiral as before.\nRounds 2-3: Sc in each st around \u2013 6 sts.\nFasten off leaving a sewing length. Using sewing length and yarn needle, weave yarn through front loop of each of the last 6 sts and pull tight to close top of toe. Line up 3 Toes in a row with sides touching and tops of toes (last rounds) all pointing upwards. Using sewing lengths, sew sides of 3 Toes together securely. Repeat for other set of 3 Toes. Sew each set of Toes securely to bottom of body using remaining yarn tails and yarn needle. NOTE: These attachments must be secure enough to withstand the agitation from the washing machine during the felting process.\n\nFINISHING\nWith wedge of pupil facing the same direction for each eye (see photo), position Eyes on front of Body. When you are happy with the expression of the eyes, using yarn tails and yarn needle, sew Eyes securely in place. Using D and yarn needle, satin stitch the beak onto face using photo as a guide. Felt purse in washing machine to desired measurements using a small amount of detergent. Run through 2 complete warm wash cycles in a small load. For best results check owl a few times during felting process. After felting is complete, shape it with your hands and lay it flat on a towel to dry. After it dries completely, use a pair of scissors to trim off some of the fuzziness around the eyes. Using sewing needle and thread, sew male side of snap to inside tip of flap. Sew female side of snap to face opposite of male snap.",

Weave in yarn ends.\nCrochet Handles and Trim\nHolding 4 strands of B together, crochet 3 chains, each 6\u2019 long.\nseam and Prepare for Felting\nPin bottom and sides to front and back pieces, leaving top 2\u201d on each side unattached (will be trimmed after felting). With A, sew in place.\nFELTING\nPlace chains in a mesh laundry bag or a pillow case. Set a washer to hot, heavy-duty cycle, and low water. Add the purse and bag with chains. Run one wash (agitation only) cycle, removing pieces several times during process to check progress. Two or more cycles may be needed before satisfied results are achieved. Remove pieces when measurements are correct, pieces are stiff to the touch, and the stitch definition is nearly invisible. Rinse in cool water to stop the felting process. Flatten out chains so they are uniform in size and length. Shape the purse by squaring off the bottom and sides. If possible, dry the purse on a form that is the correct proportion, like a cardboard box. This will help ensure the purse maintains its crisp edges. Dry pieces thoroughly away from heat. Trim excess (if necessary) from side pieces left unattached when seaming. Fold pieces in half toward inside of purse at top edge to form a pleat, whip stitch together. Whip stitch front and back pieces together from top edge of purse to pleat.\nWith B, whip stitch length of chain around sides and bottom of front and back of purse beginning at top edge working down side, across bottom and up opposite side to top edge.\nWith C, embroider blanket stitch across top edges of front and back of purse. With crochet hook, make 1 sc in first blanket st, * ch 3, 1 sc in same ch as last sc, 1 sc in next blanket st; repeat from * across.\nAttach Handles\n* Holding 3 strands of chain together, each approximately 30\u201d long, thread one end through first D-Ring 1\u00bd\u201d. Wrap an 8\u201d length of B around chains and ends to secure and close pocket. Repeat for second D-Ring. Attach these 2 D-Rings to purse front. Repeat for purse back.\nOptional Interfacing\nFor Interfacing, whip stitch each 17\u201d x 10\u00bd\u201d piece of plastic canvas (front and back) to 17\u201d x 3\u201d piece (bottom) to make purse form. Insert form into purse. Tack pieces into place, being sure bottom fits correctly and securely before tacking in place.\nOptional Lining\nFold fabric in half lengthwise. Stitch \u00bd\u201d side seams from the top down on each side. Turn top raw edge over \u00bd\u201d and press. Insert lining into purse, folding bottom side edges into a triangle to form flat bottom. Tack top of triangle to side seam on each side. \nInsert magnetic closures following manufacturer\u2019s instructions to center top edges of lining. Sew around top edges to attach lining to purse.",

Box 40 Listowel ON  N4W 3H3\nImportant to know before felting\n\u2022 Record all the measurements and changes before and after felting. You will be able to adjust the method to produce proper results.\n\u2022 Always test a sample. Different colored yarns may felt differently.\n\u2022 Colorfastness can be affected by very hot water.\n\u2022 Any knitting that has been properly felted becomes very dense and matted.\nHow To Felt\n\u2022 Using low water level, run a Hot/Cold cycle for 5 to 15 min. Add a pair of old jeans for agitation.\n\u2022 Add 2 tablespoons of baking soda for a small load. After one cycle, check for size. Repeat if necessary.\n\u2022 Run through the rinse and dry spin cycle.\n\u2022 Do not use a clothes dryer.\n\u2022 Shape piece to correct measurements.\n\u2022 Lay felted piece onto a dry towel, away from direct heat or sunlight.\n\u2022 If an edge ripples, baste a thread through the edge and gather in. Remove the thread after the felting is dry.",

Do not join at end of rnds.\n\nSetting Up Stitches on Coats & Clark\u2122 Yarn Zip\nPrepare zipper:\nUsing a pen or pencil, make small dots along right side of zipper \u00bc\" [0.6 cm] up from bottom zipper stop and 8\" [20.5 cm] up from this bottom mark. Make small markings every \u00bc\" [0.6 cm] between these 2 points along right side of loose-weave channel on zipper tape. There should be 33 dots spaced evenly along side of zipper. \nRepeat on left side of zipper.\n\nBegin working into zipper:\nWith smaller hook, insert hook into top of zipper at bottom mark \u00bc\" [0.6 cm] up from zipper stop. Holding yarn behind zipper, draw up a loop. Insert hook at next \u00bc\" [0.6 cm] marking and draw up a loop (2 loops on hook). Draw this loop through first loop, being sure to not pull too tightly. \nContinue in this manner, inserting hook at each \u00bc\" [0.6 cm] marking, pulling up a loop and drawing it through loop on hook. Once top of zipper is reached, you should have 32 chain sts along right side of zipper.\nPull zipper head down below top marking. Working across top of zipper, insert hook into top marking on left side, drawing up a slightly longer loop to span across top of zipper.\nWork down left side of zipper as on opposite side to bottom marking. Make 1 last chain st across bottom of zipper, into same space as first chain. Pull loop from top of zipper to WS and fasten off. Cut yarn leaving approx 4\" [10 cm] tail.\n\nPOUCH\n1st rnd: With larger hook, join yarn with sl st to first ch st on right side. Ch 1. Working through right \u2018leg\u2019 of chain only, work 1 sc in each ch st to top of zipper (32 sc). Work 1 sc in ch across top of zipper. Work 1 sc in each of 32 ch down left side of zipper. Work 1 sc in ch across bottom of zipper. Join with sl st to first sc. 66 sc.\n\n2nd rnd: Ch 1. *Sc2tog. 1 sc in each of next 28 sc. Sc2tog. 1 sc in next sc. Rep from * once more. Do not join. Place marker on last st. 62 sts.\n\n3rd rnd: 1 sc in each sc around. Rep last rnd, moving end of rnd marker up at end of each rnd, until work from edge of zipper measures 5\" [12.5 cm].\n\nFINISHING\nSl st in next sc to complete final rnd. Fasten off, leaving a long yarn end to seam bottom of Pouch. Lay Pouch flat, aligning sts of last rnd. Using yarn tail, sew bottom of Pouch closed. Weave in ends.",

Do not use fabric softener. Remove bag and check amount of felting during this process. Two or more wash cycles may be needed before you will be satisfied with the effect. One or two tablespoons of baking soda in the wash may speed the process \u2013 check frequently. Repeat until pieces are felted and bag is desired size. Rinse in cool water to stop the felting process and to remove the soap. Pull bag into shape and allow to dry away from sun or heat for a day or two. Felting may cause a certain amount of pilling which is easily removed by brushing briskly with a hard nylon brush.\nRED HEART\u00ae \u201cEco-Ways\u2122 Bamboo Wool\u2122\u201d, Art. 754 available in 1.76 oz (50 g), 87 yd (80 m) balls.",

HOW TO FELT INSTRUCTIONS FELTING \u2022 Put pieces in top-loading washing machine. Put in a pair of jeans or large towel (in non-interfering color) for extra agitation. Using low water level, run a Hot/Cold cycle for 15 min. \u2022 Add 2 tablespoons of baking soda for a small load. After one cycle, check for size. Repeat as necessary. \u2022 Run through the rinse and dry spin cycle. \u2022 Lay felted piece on a dry towel, away from direct heat or sunlight. \u2022 Shape piece to correct measurements. \u2022 Allow to dry thoroughly. Do not use a clothes dryer. \u2022 If an edge ripples, baste a thread through the edge and gather in. Remove the thread after felted item is dry. \u2022 When piece is dry, use tailor's chalk to mark cutting (trimming) lines. AFTERCARE \u2022 You have spent a lot of time and care completing these items through their knitting/crocheting and felting stages. A little thought to aftercare will ensure that you will have these beautiful felted items for many years to come. \u2022 After you have subjected your item to the felting process, you may think that it has gone through the most vigorous and tortured wash that yarn could ever endure. Now you assume that you can throw that felted item into the hot wash cycle along with your sheets. Do not do it! Treat your newly felted item with caution and care in order to avoid further shrinkage or distortion. \u2022 Felted handmade items can always be improved with brushing. \u2022 Even a slight pressing will give a smoother appearance to felted fabric. Always press lightly using a steam iron and a damp cloth. Never press down on the fabric but hold the iron just above the fabric.",
