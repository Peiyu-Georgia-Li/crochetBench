Fasten off.\nFace\n3rd rnd: With right side facing, working in back loops only, join B with slip st in marked sc of 2nd rnd, remove marker, ch 1, sc in same sc and in each remaining sc around; join with slip st in first sc\u201414 sc.\n\n4th rnd: [Sc in next st, 2 sc in next st] 7 times; do not join, work in continuous rounds (spiral)\u201421 sc.\nPlace a marker in the last sc worked to indicate end of round. Move marker up as each round is completed.\n5th rnd: [Sc in next 2 sts, 2 sc in next st] 7 times\u201428 sc.\n6th rnd: [Sc in next 3 sts, 2 sc in next st] 7 times\u201435 sc.\n7th rnd: [Sc in next 4 sts, 2 sc in next st] 7 times\u201442 sc.\n8th rnd: [Sc in next 5 sts, 2 sc in next st] 7 times\u201449 sc.\n9th rnd: [Sc in next 6 sts, 2 sc in next st] 7 times\u201456 sc.\n10th and 11th rnds: Sc in each st around.\n12th rnd: Sc in each st around; join with slip st in first sc of this round. Fasten off.\n13th rnd: With right side facing, working in back loops only, join A with slip st in first sc of 12th rnd (same sc as joining slip st), ch 1, sc in same sc and in each remaining sc around; do not join, work in continuous rounds (spiral)\u201456 sc.\n\nPlace a marker in the last sc worked to indicate end of round. Move marker up as each round is completed.\nDo not fasten off.\n\nAttach Eyes\nUse a length of contrasting color scrap yarn to mark face for eye patch placement as follows: Thread scrap yarn onto yarn needle. Imagine a straight line across face that lies straight across widest part of nose. Insert needle from back, onto the line and about 3 rounds in from edge of face (face is B-colored part), bring yarn straight across widest part of nose and then insert needle from front about 3 rounds in from opposite edge of face.\n\nAttach a safety eye and eye patch on one side of face as follows: Insert a safety eye into the middle of the circular portion of one eye patch then between 9th and 10th rnds of the face and on the scrap yarn line. Do not attach washer. Repeat to position second eye and eye patch on opposite side of face. Check for even placement. Make certain that the narrow portion (Row 3) of each eye patch faces downwards and outwards from the eye and that both eye patches are at about the same angle. Snap the safety eye washers into place. Do not sew the eye patches in place, they will be sewn to face later.\nTips: Pinning the eye patches using straight pins may be helpful in assuring that the patch locations and angles match. If double layer of crochet fabric is too thick to snap the washer in place, try putting the washer on upside down with the small raised ring on top of the washer facing in towards the post.\n\nBack of Head\n14th to 18th rnd: Sc in each st around.\n19th rnd: [Sc in next 6 sts, sc2tog] 7 times\u201449 sc.\n20th and 21st rnds: Sc in each st around.\n22nd rnd: [Sc in next 5 sts, sc2tog] 7 times\u201442 sc.\n23rd rnd: Sc in each st around.\n24th rnd: [Sc in next 4 sts, sc2tog] 7 times\u201435 sc.\n25th rnd: Sc in each st around.\n26th rnd: [Sc in next 3 sts, sc2tog] 7 times\u201428 sc.\nStuff piece firmly.\n27th rnd: [Sc in next 2 sts, sc2tog] 7 times\u201421 sc.\n28th rnd: [Sc in next st, sc2tog] 7 times\u201414 sc.\nFinish stuffing piece. Fasten off, leaving a long tail. Thread ending tail through stitches of last round and pull to close opening. Securely weave in and trim end.\n\nBODY\nBeginning at bottom of body with A, make an adjustable ring.\n1st rnd (right side): Ch 1, work 6 sc in ring; do not join, work in continuous rounds (spiral)\u20146 sc.\nPlace a marker in the last sc worked to indicate end of round. Move marker up as each round is completed.\n2nd rnd: Work 2 sc in each st around\u201412 sc.\n3rd rnd: [Sc in next st, 2 sc in next st] 6 times\u201418 sc.\n4th rnd: [Sc in next 2 sts, 2 sc in next st] 6 times\u201424 sc.\n5th rnd: [Sc in next 3 sts, 2 sc in next st] 6 times\u201430 sc.\n6th rnd: [Sc in next 4 sts, 2 sc in next st] 6 times\u201436 sc.\n7th rnd: [Sc in next 5 sts, 2 sc in next st] 6 times\u201442 sc.\n8th rnd: [Sc in next 6 sts, 2 sc in next st] 6 times\u201448 sc.\n9th rnd: [Sc in next 7 sts, 2 sc in next st] 6 times\u201454 sc.\n10th rnd: [Sc in next 8 sts, 2 sc in next st] 6 times\u201460 sc.\n11th rnd: [Sc in next 9 sts, 2 sc in next st] 6 times\u201466 sc.\n12th to 14th rnds: Sc in each st around.\nNote: Some stitches of next round are worked only into back loops. Later, the tops of the legs are sewn to the unused front loops.\n15th rnd: Sc-blo in next 8 sts, sc in next 6 sts, sc-blo in next 8 sts, sc in each remaining st around.\n16th to 21st rnds: Sc in each st around.\n22nd rnd: [Sc in next 9 sts, sc2tog] 6 times\u201460 sc.\n23rd rnd: [Sc in next 4 sts, sc2tog] 10 times\u201450 sc.\n24th to 30th rnds: Sc in each st around.\n31st rnd: [Sc in next 8 sts, sc2tog] 5 times\u201445 sc.\n32nd rnd: [Sc in next 7 sts, sc2tog] 5 times\u201440 sc.\n33rd rnd: [Sc in next 6 sts, sc2tog] 5 times\u201435 sc.\n\nNeck\n34th rnd: [Sc in next 5 sts, sc2tog] 5 times\u201430 sc.\n\nMark Stitches for Arm Placement\nUse a length of contrasting color scrap yarn to mark for arm placement as follows: Hold one end of scrap yarn immediately before the first unworked front loop of 15th rnd. Stretch the scrap yarn upwards in a straight line to 34th rnd and place a marker in the 34th rnd stitch at the straight line. Moving towards the back, skip the next 5 stitches of 34th rnd and place a marker in the next stitch. The two markers just placed indicate the beginning and ending stitches where one arm will be attached. Repeat this process to mark stitches for the other arm, beginning by holding one end of scrap yarn immediately following the last unworked front loop of 15th rnd.\n\n35th rnd: *Sc in each st to next arm marker, hold top of arm against 34th rnd with sts matching the marked sts and the sts between the markers; working through both layers, sc in next 7 sts; repeat from * once more, sc in each st to end of round\u201430 sc. Remove arm markers.\n\n36th to 38th rnds: Sc in each st around.\nStuff piece firmly.\nFasten off, leaving a long tail for sewing head to body.\n\nClaws\nWorking into stitches of last round of leg and over the sewing stitches used to close end of leg. Skip first st, join B with slip st in next st, *ch 6, slip st in back bump of 2nd ch from hook and in back bump of next 4 ch, slip st in same st of leg and in next st of leg; repeat from * twice more (3 claws made).\nFasten off. Weave in and trim ends. Repeat to work claws on second leg and both arms.\n\nFINISHING\nPin eye patches to face. Sew patches securely in place, using small whip stitches.\nWith three strands of black embroidery floss embroider a running stitch or outline stitch upward curving mouth on face. Embroider mouth over six single crochet stitches, evenly spaced about three rounds down from the bottom of the nose and following the curvature of the single crochet stitches.\nSew head to neck. Sew legs to free front loops from 15th rnd of body. Match the top edge of the leg with the eight unworked front loops.",

Weave in ends.\n\nCONTINENTS\nSquare (make 1 each using D, E and F)\nWith I-9 hook, make a 10\u201d long ch.\nRow 1: Sc in 2nd ch from hook, sc in each ch across, turn.\nRow 2: Ch 1, sc in each sc across, turn.\nRep row 2 until square measures 10\u201d deep. Fasten off. \n\nFELTING\nPlace 10\u201d squares in mesh sweater bag or pillowcase and close. Using hottest possible water and approximately 2 tablespoons liquid hand soap, fill washer 1/3 full. Place squares in washer with an old pair of jeans (for agitation).  \nAgitate for 6 minutes. Check the felting progress every minute after 6 minutes; depending on your washer, it will take 6-8 minutes of agitation to felt the desired amount. \nWhen you\u2019re pleased with the amount of felting, and felted gauge is achieved, remove the squares and drain wash water from machine; gently squeeze water from squares. \nFill washer to the same water level with cold water. Place squares into washer and rinse/agitate for another minute \u2013 the cold water will make the squares felt just a bit more.\nSet machine to drain, then run spin cycle for approximately 30 seconds (creases caused by over spinning are difficult to remove from the finished piece). Remove squares, gently stretching into shape, if needed. Drying process may take up to 2 days, depending on humidity in the air.\n\nFINISHING\nTrace pattern pieces and cut out. Using pattern pieces, cut out North America and Asia from D square; cut Africa and Australia from E square; and cut Europe and South America from F. With hot glue, glue continents to globe in proper position. Cut a 28\u201d length of fishing line. Thread fishing line onto yarn needle, insert needle \u00bd\u201d from center top of globe cover, exit 1\u201d away on opposite side of center. Draw fishing line through and bring ends together. Using yarn needle, draw 2 ends of fishing line through bird, from center bottom to center top of body. With fishing line measuring approximately 9\u201d from bird to globe, tie ends of line in several overhand knots at top of bird to secure. Cut four 22\u201d lengths of fishing line. Tie one length of fishing line to each side of ring, equally spaces around. With yarn needle, draw 4 lengths of fishing line through bird, from center bottom to center top of body. Adjust lengths of fishing line to place ring, slightly tilted, around center of globe. Tie 4 ends of fishing line in an overhand knot at top of bird to secure. With all 6 strands of fishing line at top of bird, tie in an overhand knot approximately 2\u201d from top of bird to make hanging loop. Cut off excess fishing line.",

Sew head to body, taking care to position face frontwards.\n2. Sew arms to upper sides of body at Rounds 3 and 4.\n3. Sew legs to lower portion of body.\nBangs: Before sewing wig base to head, embroider bangs as follows: With yarn same color as wig base, begin embroidering bangs about 2 rows above the eyes and make long stitches that will be partially hidden under the wig base. Vary the length of the bang stitches for a tousled look. Place wig base on head, overlapping bangs by a fraction of an inch. Pin in place, for best results, and sew base to head. Weave and trim ends.\nSmile: With embroidery needle and 2 strands of black embroidery floss, embroider a smile at Round 13 of head, in the middle of the face, about 3 stitches wide.\nCheeks: Cut small circles from pink felt. Referring to photo for placement, glue cheeks to face directly under and to the sides of the eyes.\nHair Version 1 (side buns)\nWith B, leaving a long beginning tail, ch 21.\nRow 1: Hdc in 2nd ch from hook, 2 hdc in next ch, *hdc in next ch, 2 hdc in next ch; repeat from * across\u201430 hdc.\nFasten off, leaving a long tail.

Fasten off, weave in and trim ends.\nNext Round of Curls: Working around Round 4 of wig base (or any round desired), repeat first round of curls.\nNotes: There is no need to fill entire wig base with curls as it will become too heavy and may make the head sag. To hide base and style the hair, pull a few lengths of the Round 4 curls to the back of head and tie loosely in back. Slip stitch lengths will curl naturally.\nWeave in and trim any remaining ends.

Blue is not used in this design.\nNotes\n\u2022 Booster Rockets and Booster Rocket frames are worked separately and sewn tog. Frames are cylindrical pieces that hold Booster Rockets on Rocketship and are fitted with a small length of plastic drinking straw to provide rigidity.\n\u2022 The clear spaceship dome (porthole), is created from half of a fillable clear plastic ornament. It is connected to Spaceship with crochet edging that is glued around the bottom edge of the dome using strong craft glue or cement. Space alien and nose cone feature are glued to a toothpick, then inserted and glued in place on Rocketship.\n\u2022 Before beg, separate different color sections of the yarn as follows: Pop center color out by pushing gently on the center of ball so that it comes out intact. Find point where color changes and cut yarn. Rep this process for rem yarn colors by carefully pushing rings of color out of larger ring and cutting. Roll each color into a ball to prevent tangling.\n\u2022 To change color, work to last 2 loops on hook and draw new color through last 2 loops and proceed, keeping color change to WS of work.\n\u2022 This project includes some optional multi-crafting techniques for finishing and embellishing. Make certain to read through entire pattern before beg.\n\u2022 Designs may not be suitable for babies and very young children as the fuzzy hair yarn and post and washer eyes could come off and pose a choking hazard.\n\nROCKETSHIP\nBeg at nosecone with B, make an adjustable ring as follows: Wrap yarn into a ring, ensuring that the tail falls behind the working yarn. Grip ring and tail between middle finger and thumb. Insert hook through center of ring, yarn over (with working yarn) and draw up a loop. Work sts of first rnd in the ring. After the first rnd of sts is worked, pull gently on tail to tighten ring.\n1st rnd: 5 sc in ring. Do not join. Work in continuous rnds (spiral). 5 sc. PM in last sc worked to indicate end of rnd.

Fasten off.\nAttach Edging to Dome: Carefully break off the hanging tab on the edge of half dome. To keep table clean and prevent dome from sticking to table, work on piece of waxed paper. Sew short ends of edging tog to form a circle. Run a bead of strong craft glue around edge of dome. Place glued dome flat on waxed paper. Slip edging down over dome with B-colored side up, pushing it down until A-colored edge is lying flat on the surface. \nNote: A-colored edge will be sewn to Spaceship. Set aside to dry.\n\nPOMPOM ALIEN\nCut toothpick in half (save second half for nosecone embellishment). Glue medium-sized pompom to flat (cut) tip of toothpick and allow glue to dry. Glue 2 beads to upper front of pompom head to form eyes. Glue two small pompoms to upper sides of pompom head (as if wearing headphones) and allow glue to dry for several hours.\n\nPOMPOM NOSECONE\nGlue one small pompom to flat tip of second half of toothpick and allow glue to dry.\n\nFLAMES\nLarge Flame\nWrap D around 4 fingers 5 times.

Sew Booster Rockets, evenly spaced around rnds 38 and 39 of Rocketship approx 14 - 15 sts apart.\n\nAttach and Embellish Alien:  Insert the pompom alien toothpick into upper side of spaceship evenly spaced between 2 Booster Rockets. Check position by placing dome over alien to make certain placement is as desired and that face is looking in desired direction. Remove toothpick, place a small amount of glue on toothpick and reinsert. Allow glue to dry for several hours. Likewise, glue nose cone embellishment in middle of top of nosecone and allow glue to dry.\n\nAttach Dome/Porthole:  Place porthole dome over pompom alien and pin edging to Rocketship. For nearly invisible results, use hand-sewing thread to attach the dome to the Rocketship. \n\nAttach Large Flame to Rocketship:  Stuff tied end of large flame into end of Rocketship, making certain to stuff all yarn ties inside. With yarn tail still attached to spaceship, sew through the stitches of last rnd, and top portion of flame to anchor it, then cinch tightly. Knot yarn securely, weave and trim excess. Trim the flame into a point (resembling the flame of a candle). Twist newly trimmed ends of flame several times between thumb and pointer finger to felt the ends tog, thus maintaining the pointed shaping.\n\nAttach Flames to Rockets: Attach one small flame to each rocket booster in the same manner as large flame was attached to Rocketship. If desired, attach thread or fishing line to Rocketship for hanging loop.\n\nALIEN\n\nLEGS/BODY\nFirst Leg\nBeg at bottom of leg with A, make an adjustable ring as given for Rocketship.\n1st rnd:  6 sc in ring.

Wrap D around fingers 40 times, then wrap C around fingers 40 times, and finally wrap B around fingers 40 times, for a total of 120 wraps.\nWhile wraps are still on fingers, slip the 12\u201d (30.5 cm) yarn length under the wraps and slip the wraps off your fingers. Tie 12\u201d (30.5 cm) length tightly around wraps. Hold yarn wraps tightly in fist with 12\u201d (30.5 cm) tie dangling from bottom of fist and the looped wraps extending over top of closed fist. Using sharp craft scissors, carefully trim loops to form pompom. Grasp pompom by 12\u201d (30.5 cm) tie and shake to fluff out. Make another pompom identical to the first. With the 12\u201d (30.5 cm) ties, tie the two pompoms together. Leaving ends of ties free, apply a moderate amount of craft glue to knot and let dry. With ties and yarn needle attach pompom to hat.\nMINI SKEIN OF YARN\nCut two 12\u201d (30.5 cm) lengths of any color yarn and set aside. Hold four fingers extended and slightly spread. Wrap yarn color of your choice around fingers 50 times. While wraps are still on fingers, slip one of the 12\u201d (30.5 cm) length under the wraps and slip the wraps off your fingers. Knot 12\u201d (30.5 cm) length tightly around wraps.\nHold wraps by tie and smooth out yarn so that it hangs straight. Slip second tie through opposite end of wraps and knot around wraps tightly. Apply a moderate amount of craft glue to knots and let dry. Weave ends through skein and trim. Set aside.\nLabel\nMake a copy of the mini Red Heart label. If needed, reduce image size to fit mini skein. Then print image on color printer. To reinforce label use clear cellophane tape placed carefully over image or image can be laminated. Trim label width and length to fit skein, wrap around middle of skein and tape securely.\nFINISHING\nNote: Whenever possible, use yarn tails still attached to pieces to sew the pieces in place. Using photograph as a guide, sew arms to shoulders of snowman near beginning of cardigan sweater. Sew hat to head. Sew nose to lower portion of head. With sewing needle and black thread, sew eyes above nose, and sew four black buttons evenly spaced down the button band of the cardigan sweater. Place crochet hook in palm of one hand. Sew hand closed around the hook. Place small amount of glue where hand grips the hook for extra security. Tie scarf around neck, so that end of scarf with long yarn tail falls in front. Tack scarf in place using matching yarn, as desired. Insert plastic hook through a couple loops at end of scarf. Wrap the long yarn tail around throat of hook (as if making a yarn over) then tie the tail to one end of the mini skein and weave loose end into the skein. Glue the \u201cstitches\u201d wrapped around the hook in place using craft glue. Weave in any remaining ends.",

You\u2019ll find these \ntwo friends prancing in the enchanted forest, \nchatting with the pixies and getting the \nlatest gossip from the birds. \nUnicorn measures about 4\" [10 cm] tall \nand 4\" [10 cm] long (measured from \ntip of nose to rear end).\nNotes\n1. Before beginning, separate the\ndifferent color sections of the yarn as\nfollows: Pop the center color out by\npushing gently on the center of the\nball so that it comes out intact. Find\nthe point where the color changes\nand cut the yarn. Repeat this process\nfor the remaining yarn colors by\ncarefully pushing the rings of color\nout of the larger ring and cutting.\nWind each color into a separate ball\nto prevent tangling. You may find\nthat one color appears both in the\ncenter, and on the outside of the ball,\nwind together or separately.  In the\npattern instructions, the white color\nis referred to as A, the pink as B, the\nturquoise as C, and the yellow as D.\n2. Unicorn is made from 16 pieces: Body,\nhead, neck, 4 legs, 2 ears, forelock,\n3 mane pieces, and 3 tail pieces.\nIn addition, 2 wings are made for\nstriped unicorn.\n3. Unicorn is designed in two versions:\nsolid and striped.\n4. Pieces are sewn together using yarn\ntails or yarn scraps.\n5. To change yarn color, work last\nstitch of old color to last yarn\nover. Yarn over with new color and\ndraw through all loops on hook to\ncomplete stitch. Proceed with new\ncolor. Do not fasten off old color until\ninstructed.

Do not join rounds (rnds). There are no chains (ch) worked at beginning (beg) of rnd unless otherwise stated; simply work directly into the next stitch (st) (noting marker to indicate end of rnd will move up each rnd).\n\nALL CHARACTERS\nEgg Base\nWith MC, make a slip knot and place it on the hook.\nSlip Knot\nMake a loop with the yarn and fold it on itself to make a pretzel shape. Then draw through to make slip knot.\nChain (ch) 4.\nYarn over hook (Yoh), draw through loop \u2013 1 chain made. Repeat (rep) last step 3 times more \u2013 4 chains made.\nJoin with slip stitch (sl st) to first ch to form ring.\n1st rnd: Ch 1. Work 10 single crochet (sc) in ring. Place Marker (PM) on last stitch (st).\n\nIncreasing : Work 2 sc in stitch (st).\nRep last step 9 times more \u2013 10 sc made.\n2nd rnd: *1 sc in next sc. 2 sc in next sc. Repeat (rep) from * around. 15 sc.\nMove marker to new last st at end of each round (rnd).\n3rd rnd: *1 sc in each of next 2 sc. 2 sc in next sc. Rep from * around. 20 sc.\n4th rnd: 1 sc in each sc around.\n5th rnd: *1 sc in each of next 3 sc. 2 sc in next sc. Rep from * around. 25 sc.\n6th rnd: *1 sc in each of next 4 sc. 2 sc in next sc. Rep from * around. 30 sc.\nNote: Your work should start curling in on the sides at this point.\n7th rnd: 1 sc in each sc around.\n8th rnd: *1 sc in each of next 5 sc. 2 sc in next sc. Rep from * around. 35 sc.\n9th to 15th rnds: 1 sc in each sc around.\nTip: To help keep track of your rounds, you can use multiple stitch markers, leaving the last stitch of each rnd marked.\n16th rnd: *1 sc in each of next 5 sc. Single crochet 2 stitches together (Sc2tog). Rep from * around. 30 sts.\nSc2tog:\nInsert hook into next st, yoh and draw up a loop. 2 loops on hook. Insert hook into next st. Yoh and draw up a loop. 3 loops on hook. Yoh and draw through all 3 loops on hook - Sc2tog made.\n\n30 sts at end of rnd.\n17th rnd: *1 sc in each of next 4 sts. Sc2tog. Rep from * around. 25 sts.\n18th rnd: *1 sc in each of next 3 sts. Sc2tog. Rep from * around. 20 sts.\nUse stitch marker to hold loop on hook for next step, remove hook.\n\nStuffing\nUsing spare yarn, wrap around 3 fingers 50 times. Trim yarn, leaving a long tail, and slide wraps off fingers. Using the tail, tie around bundle of yarn to create stuffing.\nStuff Egg Base with yarn bundles. Rep until Egg Base is fully stuffed, approx 7 bundles, before moving on to next rnd. \nRemove stitch marker from loop and put loop on hook. PM on last st worked.\n19th rnd: *1 sc in each of next 2 sts. Sc2tog. Rep from * around. 15 sts.\n20th rnd: *1 sc in next st. Sc2tog. Rep from * around. 10 sts.\n21st rnd: *Sc2tog. Rep from * around. 5 sts. Fasten off leaving a long tail.\nThread long yarn tail onto yarn needle and draw long tail tightly through remaining (rem) sts and secure tightly. Weave in all yarn tails.\n\nCHARACTER DETAILS\nUse Main Color (MC) or Contrast Color (A), and white/black yarn, to make pieces for Egg Base to customize your character. Use Simple Circles, Simple Triangles, chains and embroidery to make features.\n\nSimple Circle:\nCh 2.\n1st rnd: Work 6 sc in second ch from hook. Do not turn.\nContinue (cont) working in a spiral as follows:\n2nd rnd: 2 sc in each of next 6 sc. 12 sc total.\n3rd rnd: (1 sc in next sc. 2 sc in next sc) 6 times. 18 sc total.\n4th rnd: (1 sc in next 2 sc. 2 sc in next sc) 6 times. Sl st into first sc. 24 sc total.\nFasten off, leaving a long tail for sewing.\nNote: Make your Circle bigger by working more rnds, making sure to increase 6 times, evenly spaced around each rnd. Make your Circle smaller by working fewer rnds.\n\nSimple Triangle:\nCh 2.\n1st row: 1 sc in second ch from hook. Turn.\n2nd row: Ch 1. 3 sc in first sc. Turn.\n3rd row: Ch 1. 1 sc in each sc to end of row. Turn. 3 sc total.\n4th row: Ch 1. 2 sc in first sc. 1 sc in next sc. 2 sc in last sc. Turn. 5 sc total.\n5th row: Ch 1. 1 sc in each sc to end of row. Turn. 5 sc total.\nFasten off, leaving a long tail for sewing.\nNote: Make your Triangle bigger by working more rows, working increases at the beg and end of every alternate row.\nHere are a few examples of characters you can make with these details. Be creative with your details to make the creature of your dreams!\nKerry the Koala = Egg Base + 5 Simple Circles + 2 lengths of chains + embroidery.\nChuck the Chick = Egg Base + 3 Simple Triangles + 1 length of chains + embroidery.\nFreddy the Frog = Egg Base + 2 Simple Triangles + 1 Simple Circle + 2 lengths of chains + embroidery.\nGilda the Goldfish = Egg Base + 4 Simple Triangles + 4 Simple Circles.\nDennis the Dino = Egg Base + 4 Simple Triangles + 4 Simple Circles + 2 lengths of chains + embroidery.\nWe love seeing your makes!

        "instructions": "Notes\n1. Before beginning, separate the different color sections of the yarn as follows: Pop the center color out by pushing gently on the center of the ball so that it comes out intact. Find the point where the color changes and cut the yarn. Repeat this process for the remaining yarn colors by carefully pushing the rings of color out of the larger ring and cutting. Wind each color into a ball to prevent tangling. You may find that one color appears both in the center, and on the outside of the ball, wind together or separately. In the pattern instructions, the light grey or dark grey color is referred to as A, the white as B, and the pink as C.\n2. Elephant is made from 10 pieces: Head, body, 2 ears (2 parts each), 2 arms, 2 legs, a tail, and a hat. Unless otherwise indicated, each piece is worked in continuous rnds (spiral) with right side always facing.\n3. Pieces are sewn together using yarn scraps, yarn tails or sewing thread.\n4. Take care to attach safety eyes before head opening becomes too small. Do not use safety eyes if toy is intended for a child 2 years of age or younger.\n5. Yarn color is changed when working Elephant's shirt. To change yarn color, work last stitch of old color to last yarn over. Yarn over with new color and draw through all loops on hook to complete stitch. Carry color not in use along the inside of the piece until next needed.\nSpecial Stitches\njoin with sc = Place a slip knot on hook, insert hook in indicated stitch, yarn over and draw up a loop, yarn over and draw through both loops on hook.\nsc2tog (single crochet 2 stitches together) = [Insert hook in next stitch, yarn over and pull up a loop] twice, yarn over and draw through all 3 loops on hook.\nSpecial Technique\nAdjustable ring = Wrap yarn into a ring, ensuring that the tail falls behind the working yarn. Grip ring and tail between middle finger and thumb. Insert hook through center of ring, yarn over (with working yarn) and draw up a loop. Work stitches of first round in the ring. After the first round of stitches is worked, pull gently on tail to tighten the ring.\nHEAD\nBeginning from top of head with A, make an adjustable ring.\nRound 1 (right side): Work 6 sc in ring; do not join, work in continuous rounds (spiral)\u20146 sc.\nPlace a marker in the last sc worked to indicate end of round.

Fasten off. Stuff head. With yarn needle and F, embroider straight stitches across top of head for hair. Begin by sewing a long straight stitch from one side of top front of head to back center of head to define the part. Then embroider straight sts across the head from the part to the sides of the head. Keep working stitches between the part and sides of head, gradually working towards the back of the head. Keep the stitches very close together, even allowing them to overlap from time to time. Vary the length of the stitches to approximate the look of real hair. Work longer stitches over the top of the head and shorter stitches near the lower edges of the sides to add texture and make shaping the lower edges of the hair easier. Embroider shorter straight stitches near the front of the part for a cowlick and on either side of the front of the face for sideburns.\n\nNotes: It is important to stuff the head before embroidering the hair to prevent the head from puckering as the stitches are worked. Pay attention to the tension of the stitches as you want them to be tight enough to sit smoothly on the head, but not so tight that they deform the head. Stuffing may stick to the needle as you embroider. Take care not to pull the stuffing all the way through to the outside.\n\nEARS (make 2)\nWith H, ch 4.\nRow 1: Working in back bars, slip st in first ch from hook sc in next ch, dc in next ch, slip st in last ch.

Join the end of the head strap \nwith a slip st in the opposite side of the \nnoseband circle.\nFasten off, knotting the yarn end \nsecurely. Place halter on llama.\n\nTassels (make 3 \u2013 1 each with B, C, D)\n1. Cut 2 lengths of C, about 3\" [7.5 cm]\nlong for ties.\n2. Cut 3 strands of tassel color yarn,\nabout 2\" [5 cm] long.\n3. Hold the 3 strands together and fold\nin half.\n4. Thread one of the 3\" [7.5 cm] ties\nthrough the fold then tie into a knot\nfor top of tassel.\n5. Tie remaining 3\" [7.5 cm] tie around\nthe top of the tassel, about \u215b\" [3\nmm] below top of tassel, for tassel\nneck. Trim ends even. Place a small\ndot of glue on knot to secure.\nRepeat this process to make all 3 \ntassels. Using photograph as a guide \nto placement and using yarn tails or \nyarn scraps, tie two of the tassels to \nthe halter, where noseband and head \nstrap meet. Tie third tassel to one of the \nllama's ears.\nPlace blanket on back of llama and tack \nin place using same yarn color as used \nfor body. \nWeave in and trim any remaining ends.",

Cut a 10\"/25.5cm length of yarn and split the length into 2 strands, each strand should be thin enough to sew the beads to the tiara. Sew one bead to RS of each point of tiara (optional).\n\nWAND\nStitches Used: Chain (ch), half double crochet (hdc), single crochet (sc), slip stitch (sl st)\nSpecial Technique: Adjustable-ring method\nWrap yarn into a ring, ensuring that tail falls behind working yarn. Between finger and thumb, grip ring and tail firmly. Insert hook through center of ring, yo (with working yarn) and draw up a lp. Yo and draw through lp on hook (first ch made). Work sts of first rnd into ring. After first rnd of sts is worked, pull gently, but firmly, on tail to tighten ring. \nNotes: Beads are optional and should not be used on wands for young children. Star is crocheted with size G-6 (4mm) hook to create a dense fabric. To make sturdy star, take care to work with a tight tension. \nSTEM\nThread yarn into yarn needle. Take needle through a 1/2\"/1cm diameter bead. Draw yarn end through about 2\"/5cm and glue end along side of one end of dowel. Glue bead to end of dowel. Wrap yarn around dowel, placing each wrap against previous wrap and glue in place as you wrap, until dowel is completely covered. Cut the end of the yarn and glue end to top of dowel. \nSTAR (make 2)\nCenter Circle\nLeaving a long beginning tail (for sewing beads to star), make an adjustable ring. \nRnd 1: Work 10 sc in ring; do not join and do not turn\u201410 sc.\nRnd 2: Working in back loops only, 2 sc in each sc around\u201420 sc.\nFirst Point\u2014Row 1: Ch 1, working in back loops only, hdc in next 4 sc, turn.
