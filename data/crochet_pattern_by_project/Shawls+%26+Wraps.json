Rebecca's passion for unique stitches coupled with wearable shapes made her the perfect choice to make this beautiful shawl that showcases crochet lace. This shawl is a great layering piece for that chilly afternoon out or just for wrapping up on the couch and enjoying a cup of tea.

Triangles are worked back and forth in rows.\n\u2022 Squares and Triangles are joined tog as they are made using a join-as-you-go technique. The technique replaces some of the sts of 4th rnd with similar sts that also join the motif you are currently making to neighboring motifs. Motifs are joined to neighboring motifs at corners and at the center of side edges.\n\u2022 The join-as-you-go technique is easy to do once you get the idea. Work 4th rnd as usual EXCEPT, when you reach a corner that needs to be joined to a previous motif, work a motif-join as you work the (dc. Ch 2. 1 dc) at the corner. When you reach the center of a side edge that needs to be joined to a previous motif, work a tr into the center of the side edge of the neighboring motif. Carefully read the description of motif-join in Abbreviations.\n\u2022 Ch 3 at beg of rnd counts as dc.\n\u2022 Join all rnds with sl st to first st.\nMOTIF 1\nSee Diagram on page 4.\nWith A, make an adjustable ring: Wrap yarn into a ring, ensuring that the tail falls behind the working yarn. Grip ring and tail between middle finger and thumb. Insert hook through center of ring, yarn over (with working yarn) and draw up a loop. Work sts of first rnd in the ring. After the first rnd of sts is worked, pull gently on tail to tighten ring.\n1st rnd: Ch 3. 15 dc in ring. Join. 16 dc.\n2nd rnd: Ch 3. 1 dc in each of next 3 dc.

Refer to layout diagram for yarn color and placement, taking special care to notice which neighboring motifs this current motif needs to be joined to. As you work Rnd 4, use the join-as-you-go technique at corners and side edges to join to neighboring motif(s).\nTRIANGLE 1\nSee Diagram on page 4.\nWith A, make an adjustable ring as given for Motif 1.\n1st row: (RS).

The body of the shawl is worked beginning across one long edge of the flower motif strip.\nFIRST MOTIF\nWith smaller hook, ch 5; join with slip st in first ch to form a ring.\nRound 1 (right side): Ch 7 (counts as dc, ch 4), dc in ring, [ch 4, dc in ring] 5 times, ch 4; join with slip st in 3rd ch of beginning ch\u20147 dc and 7 ch-4 spaces.\nRound 2: *(Slip st, ch 5, 7 dtr) in next ch-4 space (petal made), ch 1, work 3 slip sts evenly spaced down last dtr made; repeat from * around; join with slip st in same ch-space as first petal\u20137 petals.\nNEXT MOTIF (make and join 22 more)\nWork same as first motif through Round 1\u20147 dc and 7 ch-4 spaces. Current motif is now completed and joined to the previous motif when working the last two petals. Arrange and join motifs so that there are four petals of each motif across one long edge (lower edge) of strip and three petals of motif across other long edge of strip (top edge).\nRound 2 (joining round): *(Slip st, ch 5, 7 dtr) in next ch-4 space (petal made), ch 1, work 3 slip sts evenly spaced down last dtr made; repeat from * 4 more times to make 5 petals; hold current motif and previous motif with wrong sides together and sts matching, following sts are worked into the current motif except when sts of the previous motif are explicitly indicated: (slip st, ch 5, 7 dtr) in next ch-4 space, ch 1, slip st in corresponding dtr of previous motif, ch 1, work 3 slip sts evenly spaced down last dtr made, (slip st, ch 5, slip st in next dtr of previous motif, 7 dtr) in next ch-4 space, ch 1, work 3 slip sts evenly spaced down last dtr made; join with slip st in same ch-space as first petal. Shawl Row 1: With larger hook and right side of flower motif strip facing, join yarn with slip st in top of beginning ch-5 of first petal of top edge. Note: The first petal of the top edge is the first of the three petals at the top of the first motif. The third of the top three petal of the first motif is joined to the 2nd motif.

Repeat with a new strand of yarn for each line of chain spaces. See stitch diagram for location of slip stitches in chain spaces. Follow the blue dots first then the pink dots in the stitch diagram for each strand of yarn. If you want to make it truly cable like, work the slip stitches of the pink under the slip stitch of the blue every other time the two cross.\nTassels\nCut 2 pieces of yarn (note: this can be any color you choose and will be the yarn that is used to attach the tassel to the shawl and to wrap around the tassel), 12\u201d (30 cm) each, put aside. Wrap yarn around 6\u201d piece of cardboard 65 times (or for desired amount), cut on one side creating 1 bundle of 65 strands. Place bundle evenly between one 12\u201d (30 cm) piece of yarn, tie bundle into place (assure strands are even). Fold bundle so that strands are even, tie second 12\u201d (30 cm) piece of yarn around bundle, 1\u201d (2.5 cm) below knot. Trim bundle ends to make even. Make 1 more tassel in a similar manner. Sew tassels to corners of shawl.",

Note: If looser cuffs are desired, work hdc in some of the ch-1 spaces for a greater number of hdc around. Take care to have an even number of hdc in the round.\nNext Round: Ch 2 (does not count as a st) turn, Fpdc around first hdc, Bpdc around next hdc, *Fpdc around next hdc, Bpdc around next hdc; repeat from * around; join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2.\n\nFINISHING\nOuter Bands\nWith right side facing, join yarn with slip st in lower right corner.\nRound 1 (right side): Ch 1, work sc evenly spaced all the way around the outer edge; join with slip st in first sc. Notes: Work sc stitches as evenly spaced as possible so that the fabric does not pucker or flare. Designer recommends working 2 sc in the end of each row along front edges, sc in each esc and ch-1 space along back neck, and sc in each ch along opposite side of beginning ch. For best results, make an even number of sts in this round.\nRound 2: Ch 2 (does not count as a st), turn, hdc in each st around; join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2.\nRounds 3\u20137: Ch 2 (does not count as a st), turn, *Fpdc around next st, Bpdc around next st; repeat from * around; join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2.

Note that it has open mesh areas with 4 rows of holes across width of ribbon. On the bottom edge, there are randomly placed large holes, but the next row up has the same four small holes as the top edge. For the purposes of this pattern, skip the row with the large holes and crochet into the row of smaller holes.\n2. You will need to measure out and cut five 54\u201d (137 cm) strips of B with 40 sets of mesh holes in each strip. Cut through vertical bars so that the holes are left intact; the cut bars are not included in the bar count.\n3. When stitching across ends of rows, work over cut ends of vertical bars into first row of holes.\n4. Working to the same number of stitches as shown in the stitch count not as critical as working to the \u201cmultiple of 4 + 2 stitches\u201d in each row. Depending on how accurately you cut B, you may have more or less stitches than shown in the stitch count.
