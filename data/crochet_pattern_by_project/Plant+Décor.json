Trim fringe evenly.\nHangers\nCut 12 lengths of yarn 18\u201d [45.5 cm]. Holding 6 strands tog, thread through ch-4 sp at side of Plant Hanger, and fold in half so that ends meet.  Thread all strands through a wooden bead; push bead to base of strands.  Braid strands tog, with 4 strands held tog in each section of braid, until braid measures approx 5\u201d [12.5 cm]. Thread all strands through another wooden bead to finish braid, ensuring bead is seated at top of braid. With 6 strands held on each side, wrap hanger strands around wooden ring. Thread all strands through another bead, and secure with a knot.  Trim evenly. Rep for opposite side of Plant Hanger.\nTassels (make 2).\nCut a piece of cardboard 5\" [12.5 cm] wide. Wind yarn around cardboard 60 times. Break yarn leaving a long end and thread end through needle. Slip needle through all loops and tie tightly. Remove cardboard and wind yarn tightly around loops 1\" [2.5 cm] below fold. Fasten securely. Cut through rem loops and trim ends evenly.

This is the inner side of the upper (wedge) part of the form.\nOn one of the bigger rectangles, mark 1\" (2.5 cm) from each corner on each of the short edges. This will leave a 6\" (15 cm) center space between the marks at each short edge. Fold wedge piece and align the bottom edges to the marks on the larger rectangle. Using straight pins to keep wedge in place, duct tape outside of top fold of wedge, then duct tape wedge to bottom piece.\nMake second form the same way.\nCover both forms and the square piece with self-sticking plastic wrap.\nSoak first Motif in fabric stiffener until saturated; only work on piece at a time. Pin Motif flat on the square piece of foam board, pinning out all points and picots. Set aside and allow to dry thoroughly.\nSoak next Motif and center it on top fold of wedged piece so the picot joins between spires are aligned along the fold. Pin out all points and picots, making sure Motif ends up the same size as first blocked Motif. Set aside and allow to dry thoroughly.\nWork 3rd Motif same as 2nd Motif.\nSoak Base in fabric stiffener until saturated, and slide over the plastic-wrapped cone. Stretch it out evenly all around. pin in place. Set aside and allow to dry thoroughly.\nWhen all pieces are dry, gently remove from forms.\nAssembly\nLay flat Motif back on plastic covered square piece. Place a line of glue along vertical center line, dabbing picot joins. Line up one folded Motif along vertical center line and press gently together. Prop up the top Motif so it doesn\u2019t move while drying using any household object of a size that would work. Make sure all contact points on both Motifs are touching. Allow to dry thoroughly. Once dry, flip piece upside down, stabilizing and propping to allow you to attach the 2nd folded Motif. Attach 2nd side same way as the first. Once both sides are attached and thoroughly dry, remove Base from its form and set Motifs on top of Base to see where the picots touch the Base. Apply glue to touch points on Base, and set Motifs back on Base. Again prop up the pieces so they don\u2019t move while drying. Make sure all touch points are glued securely. Allow to dry thoroughly.",
