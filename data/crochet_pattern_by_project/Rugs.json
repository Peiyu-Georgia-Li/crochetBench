        "instructions": "Use Pomp-a-Doodle yarn to create a non-slip oval rug by working slip stitches and double crochets into the spaces of the rug pad. The rug is worked with the wrong side facing throughout, starting with a line in the center and spiraling out to the edges. NOTE Rug is made by working slip stitches and double crochets into the spaces of rug pad. As rug pads vary by manufacturer, the number of stitches used in each string section may vary as well. It is worked with wrong side facing throughout. First, a line is worked in the center of rug pad. Then, piece is worked in a spiral manner around to the outside edges. RUG Prep Rug Pad With wrong side facing, measure a 13\" [33 cm] line in center of rug pad, marking both ends with a marker or pen. Join A to Rug Pad With wrong side facing and holding A underneath the rug pad, insert hook into hole closest to one end of marked line on your rug pad. Working with string sections between pompoms, yarn over using string section between first pompom at end and next pompom. Pull that loop through rug pad so first pompom is held close to underside of rug pad fabric. Insert hook in next pad hole along that line and yarn over with same section of string, pull that loop through rug pad and through previous loop on hook to make a slip stitch. Insert hook in next pad hole, yarn over with next section of string, pull through rug pad and through previous loop on hook, pulling second pompom close to rug pad.Continue working slip stitches along this line until 13\" [33 cm] have been worked. Turn work in a 90-degree angle and work stitches for 1\" [2.5 cm] from long line. Turn work 90-degrees again to work parallel to original line, leaving 1\" [2.5 cm] space between lines and work slip stitches in a line. When this line is 1\" [2.5 cm] longer than previous line, turn to work along opposite edge of previous line, maintaining 1\" [2.5 cm] distance from previous stitches. Continue in an Oval Continue working like this, working 2 or 3 slip stitches for each string section, while curving around rug pad in an oval. Adding a New Ball of Yarn To add a new ball, pull up second loop of string before last pompom. Insert hook in next rug pad hole and pull up loop in string section between first two pompoms of new ball of yarn. Pull this loop through previous loop on the hook from last ball and continue working. Sew string left after each final pompom to tack it securely to rug pad. Finishing the Pomp-a-doodle Section When rug has reached desired dimensions. cut off very last pompom and use string section to pull through final stitch. Weave in ends. Trim Rug Pad Cut excess rug pad around rug, leaving 1\" [2.5 cm] outside of final round. Edging With right side facing, join B in any hole along outside edge of rug pad with a slip stitch, chain 3, double crochet evenly spaced around outside edges of rug pad, trimming off any little squares that want to poke through and adding extra stitches at corners and curves as needed. Slip stitch to top of beginning chain-3. Fasten off.",
