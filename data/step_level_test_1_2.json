Five stitches need to be decreased evenly spaced across each of the next 5 rows.\n2. Decreases are worked in the dc3tog valleys. To decrease while maintaining the ripple pattern, a dc4tog is worked instead of a dc3tog, and then fewer dc stitches are worked to reach the next peak (the center of the next 3-dc group).\n3. Markers are used to indicate the 5 valleys in which decreases will be worked. Move the markers to new locations before each decrease row, to spread out the decreases evenly over the rows.\n4. Use of markers is optional. If you do not wish to use markers, remember to work dc4tog instead of dc3tog over 5 evenly spaced valleys and take care to work fewer dc stitches to the next peak, so that peaks are kept aligned over peaks and valleys are aligned over valleys.\n5.

Pin Beak to front of Head, between eye markers to check eye placement. Adjust markers as desired. Following manufacturer\u2019s instructions, attach Safety Eyes at markers. Stuff Head, Neck and Body, being sure not to overstuff. Sew Beak in position. Sew bottom seam of Body.\nStuff Legs lightly. Using yarn tail, sew top of Leg closed and attach to Body at center bottom.
