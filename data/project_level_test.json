So, braid upward for the chevron peaks, and downward for the chevron valleys.\nFinal row (wrong side): Ch 1, *sc in each of next 11 sts, tacking sc in next st; repeat from * to last 12 sts, sc in each of last 12 sts.\nFasten off.\nRotate piece 180 degrees. With right side facing, join yarn with a slip st at beginning of foundation row and work as follows:\nRow 1 (right side): Ch 1, sc in each of next 5 sts, tacking sc in next st, * sc in each of next 11 sts, tacking sc in next st; repeat from * to last 6 sts, sc in each of last 6 sts.\nFasten off.\n\nFINISHING\nWith right sides up, match edges as shown in seaming diagram; pin to hold. (Designer suggests using mini knit clips.) Seam edges together with whip st.\nDesigner Note: once the pieces are pinned in place, take a look and see if the poncho is the right size for you. You could even try it on at this point and see if you wish to make some additions to make the piece a little larger and more custom fit for you.\nAdd some extra length to the panels by working more rows (caution: adding too much length to the panels will make your neckline too big and the poncho will fall off your shoulders) as follows: Raised Chevron Piece: undo the last double crochet row of stitching you completed then join your yarn on the last repeat row the Raised Chevron Panel and only work 1 more full row repeat. Then, work the double crochet row again and fasten off. \nLoopy st Piece: undo the final rows so that the loops are all free. Join your yarn to the last repeat row of the Loopy Chevron Panel and work as many 2 row repeats as necessary to match the new length of the Raised Chevron Panel. \nThen, rebraid where necessary, work the final rows again and fasten off. \nAnd/or: after the seaming is complete, add a couple extra rounds of half double crochet (round 2 of the edging instructions) before doing the final round of the edging to get a little extra around the body. Make Sure that you have the correct stitch multiple when indicated.\n\nBottom Edging\nWith right side facing, join yarn with a slip st in the first st to the left of a corner at bottom edge of Poncho.\nRound 1: Ch 2 (does not count as a st here and throughout), * work in hdc evenly to corner, 3 hdc in corner st and mark center st of 3 hdc just made; repeat from * once more, join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2.\nBe sure to end up with an even number of sts along each of the 2 edges, including corner sts.\nRound 2: Ch 2, * hdc in each st to marked st, 3 hdc in marked st; repeat from * once more, hdc in last hdc, join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2.\nFasten off.\nAttach a fringe at every other stitch along bottom edge as follows:\nCut 3 strands of yarn, 12\" (30.5 cm) each. Fold strands at center. Use hook to pull center of strands through edge st, then pull ends of strands through the resulting loop and pull tight.\nDesigner Note: If you decided to make your panels a bit longer, you may need to work a few extra sts on the first round of the neck edging. Try to add as few sts as possible without puckering the fabric or creating large gaps. Keep track of how many extra sts you added, then place that many markers at top edge, evenly spaced around the neck. On the second row, simply skip all the marked sts to get back to the correct number of sts needed.\n\nFoldover Turtleneck\nWith right side facing, join yarn with slip st anywhere along neck edge.\nRound 1 (right side): Ch 2 (does not count as a st here and throughout), 108 dc evenly around neck edge, join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2 \u2013 108 dc.\nRound 2: Ch 2, * bpdc around next st, fpdc around next st; repeat from * around, join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2.\nRound 3 (decrease round): Ch 2, *[bpdc around next st, fpdc around next st] 7 times, bpdc around next st, fpdc2tog over next 2 fpdc skipping the bpdc between them; repeat from * 5 more times, join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2 \u2013 96 sts,\nRounds 4-6: Repeat Round 2.\nRound 7 (decrease round) Ch 2, *[bpdc around next st, fpdc around next st] 6 times, bpdc around next st, fpdc2tog over next 2 fpdc skipping the bpdc between them; repeat from * 5 more times, join with slip st in top of beginning ch-2 \u2013 84 sts.\nRounds 8-32: Repeat Round 2.\nFasten off.",

The center front and back seams are joined, leaving room for the neck opening. Then the two side seams are joined, leaving room for the armholes. Finally, borders are added to bottom, armholes, and neck/head opening. Panels are worked lengthwise from side edges to center seam. Both Panels are worked the same.\nSPECIAL TECHNIQUE\nFsc (foundation single crochet): Ch 2, insert hook in 2nd chain from hook and draw up a loop (ch stitch made) *yarn over and draw through 2 loops on hook (sc made), insert hook in ch stitch and draw up a loop; repeat from * for as many Fsc as called for in pattern.\nFRONT AND BACK PANELS (make 2)\nMethod 1: Row 1: Work 147 (147, 155, 155, 163, 163) fsc.\nMethod 2: Ch 148 (148, 156, 156, 164, 164).\nRow 1: Sc in 2nd ch from hook, sc in each ch to end \u2013 147 (147, 155, 155, 163, 163) sc.\nFOR BOTH\nRow 2: Ch 3, (counts as first dc here and throughout), turn, dc in each sc across \u2013 147 (147, 155, 155, 163, 163) dc.

SLEEVE (make 2) Note: If you prefer to begin piece with a traditional foundation chain, instead of Fhdc, work as follows: Ch 62 (62, 68, 68, 74, 74, 80, 80, 86). Foundation Row: Hdc in 2nd ch from hook and in each remaining ch across, turn\u201461 (61, 67, 67, 73, 73, 79, 79, 85) sts. Then proceed to Row 1 of instructions.

Fasten off. Note: Length of sleeve provides for a 3-4\"/7.5-10cm cuff (to be folded back). If no cuff is desired, work each sleeve until it measures about 3-4\"/7.5-10cm less than the measurements given. FINISHING Using yarn needle, weave in all ends. Block pieces to schematic measurements. Beginning at side edge, sew shoulder seams, sewing for about 5 (6, 6 1/2, 7, 8, 8 1/2, 10, 10 1/2, 11)\"/12.5 (15, 16.5, 18, 20.5, 21.5, 25.5, 26.5, 28)cm, leaving about 6 (6 1/2, 7, 7 1/2, 8, 8 1/2, 8 1/2, 9, 9 1/2)\"/15 (16.5, 18, 19, 20.5, 21.5, 21.5, 23, 24)cm unsewn across back neck. Place top of each sleeve across one side edge, centered over shoulder seam, and sew in place. Sew side and sleeve seams. Hood With WS facing, join yarn with sc at beginning of front neck edge, work 67 (73, 73, 79, 85, 85, 85, 91, 91) sc evenly spaced around neck edge.

Beginning with Row 1, work Lace Diamond pattern until hood measures about 12\"/30.5cm when slightly stretched, end with a Row 3 of the Lace Diamond pattern. Fasten off. Block hood. Fold last row in half and seam for top of hood. Front Edging: With RS facing, join yarn with sc in lower front corner, sc evenly spaced up front edge, around front hood edge, and down opposite front edge. Fasten off. Sleeve Edging: With WS facing, join yarn with sc in sleeve seam, sc evenly spaced around sleeve edge; join with sl st in first sc. Fasten off. Repeat around 2nd sleeve. Note: Sleeve edging is worked with WS facing, so that the RS of the edging will show when the cuff is folded back. If length for the cuff was omitted, work the sleeve edging with the RS facing.",
